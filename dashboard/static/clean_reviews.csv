Roscoe Bass,2020-11-17 02:23:46,"Ever since the 1.1 update this game is completely unplayable on mobile. Everytime I play the graphics stutter heavily to the point that the game eventually just freezes. This rarely happened before the update, but now it's a constant effect everytime I try to play. It's a shame, really, cause this game WAS amazing. I was planning to spend some $$ to help the devs but now what's the point if I can't even play the game?",Negative,421,77
Miguel Lopez,2020-11-15 20:22:26,"Game keeps freezing up & crashing my Pixel 3a üòë No gamepad support. Tired of game developers not including support for gamepad controls that would make games like this one much more enjoyable to play on a small screen. The game is beautiful and has great voice acting, but instead of making it 100 percent complete, they decide to skip on something very useful and wanted by many. Who knows if they'll add gamepad support later, but it's something that should be there from day one üòë",Negative,483,87
Chun Kit Choi,2020-11-11 16:31:52,"It was one of the best games I ever played till the 1.1 update. Ever since I updated the game, it keeps crashing my phone (Galaxy S10 Plus). I have tried redownloading the game and factory restarting my phone but nothing works. Considering the amount of money I spend in this game, this is a real bummer. Please fix mihoyo!",Negative,323,60
Selvionus,2020-11-11 19:07:30,"With the recent change where they decided to make your own elemental attacks damage you more than your enemies, when taken into context with all the other baffling game design choices, I am now certain that the devs have no idea what they are actually doing and don't care about player feedback.",Negative,295,52
Luke Cichon,2020-11-12 05:27:10,"I can't fathom why a game of this caliber would a) launch without the ability to resize and rearrange our button layout, and then b) release a patch, yet again ignoring the need for something that should've been a launch feature. The current layout is horrible. You practically have to reach the center of the screen, with your thumb, in order to pan your camera. I'm thinking of quitting simply because I hate the idea of supporting a company that ignores mobile players.",Negative,472,83
„ÄåKo-sempai„Äç„Åì‚ÄìÂÖàËº©,2020-11-09 00:20:20,"When I started up the game the other day, I had one issue. The whole far right side (roughly 1in. wide) is now cut into three equal sections. It is just mirroring the immediate next section of the screen, much smaller. Hard to explain. This covers up what would normally be there if not for this glitch. Gameplay is fine and I can't interact with the duplicate controls there. It's nothing if not very distracting. If I wanna capture the screen, it's...sort of in the way. My phone is also ultra wide",Negative,500,92
Fauzan Pahlawan,2020-11-15 19:24:49,"Monetization is super predatory, If you're only a f2p player or monthly spender $20 you won't get you any value. Because by the time monthly spender saves up, the character they want is not even there anymore. For f2p you're basically have no value for them. Energy is super limited, you can get more by spending $10 per day or else you need 2 years to actually make a full team of 4 characters maxed in lvl and gears, and you need 2 team.",Negative,439,84
Bunny Dexter,2020-11-11 10:12:48,The first time you download this game its 6gb in total. Now that version 1.1 is out its another 6gb to update! Also the camera angle when fighting is horrible! It always focuses on the grass as well as it auto rotates. And this game doesn't support bluetooth controllers so its hard to see anyting. The drop rates and resin is trash! Don't waste your time and data on this game. Because the developers only care about is money and nothing else.,Negative,444,82
Marc Jones,2020-11-03 07:18:17,"If you love puzzles, play something else. If you love crafting, play something else. This game draws you in with beauty and music, then it forces you to battle mobs that requires high reflex action. So I'm watching a video about the game.

Jose Noel Geraldo,2020-11-11 07:52:42,"From 5 to 1 - the game is still very good but now it's just a monstrous cash grab, if you ever wish to maximize the strength of your character then better make sure you sell your house and assets for a high price because this game will eat it all due to the stupendous drop rate, imagine only 1 out of ten will be something you least want then like this game the power of the characters are installment, pray that you get the characters you want piece by piece with that 1 out of 10 chance",Negative,489,98
DustAndAshes,2020-11-13 12:49:28,"Overall pretty good, but please boost the 5 star rates just a little. Also the resin system. Upping it to 160 does not fix anything.

I cannot access the event page whatsoever and my tech support has gone unanswered please help",Negative,364,67
Sungkwon Yoon,2020-11-01 10:19:40,"The game is incredibly amasing. This is a game that will change the mobile gaming. However, I am experiencing a BIG issue. It is not only me actually. There are many people having this problem on internet. While I play the game, the phone makes some dangerous popping noises. I don't think it is a sound problem as the noise happens even when the game is muted. It sounds like knuckles cracking. I even feel physical vibrations with it. I am now very scared to open the app again.",Negative,480,89
Ergilys,2020-11-14 20:14:43,"The game is wonderful from the soundtrack to the graphics to the story, there is no comparison to other mobile games, however the game is heating up my phone so much that it burns my hand, not even fortnite at 60fps gets to heat up like ess, besides drink liters of battery in minutes if possible i would like them to solve these terrible problems",Negative,347,65
Cornelia S.,2020-11-11 22:42:30,It could have been great BUT.... I am playing this game on my phone and the camera function in fighting scenes is just horrible.

Mike Dane,2020-11-11 14:48:40,"Addictive AAA Gameplay, but lots of addictive gambling too. If I could go back and not play this game I would. The story is interesting enough, filled with fun characters with interesting powers. Lots of areas to explore and a decent world has been built out in mountains of lore. But all that breaks down once the heavy rewards of the initial few hours of gameplay shift into heavy consumption of said materials. It's a ""gacha"" game. If you don't know what that means then don't bother trying it.",Negative,497,89
Angelo Selitto,2020-10-30 01:23:44,"It's a game and there will always be new characters. It's guaranteed that it will take you to the pity pull to get one 5 star, let alone you need to pull them 6 more times. 200$ gets you 87 pulls and you need 90 to get that guaranteed 5 star. Great game ruined by greed. We could all be having fun and playing with different characters and even whales who spend 1000s can't even get a max 5 star. What good are graphics controls and gameplay if never get lucky with pulls, stale boring grind.",Negative,492,96

Prasad Patil,2020-11-11 14:41:43,Waste game it asked for update I did and now all 6 gb I have download again. besides Game is great but heats up lot of phones Mine redmi note 9 pro max gets heated up at low settings nearl an hour later. Some say it's same even at some high end phones. The game is great . No disappointments at all Except for this one. Help please.,Negative,332,68
Sam Sonnenschein,2020-11-12 18:25:21,This game is great and all. But I spent over $450 on wish and all I get is a bunch of blue and some purple weapons. The rng is just terrible. I wish they either fix rng or make the gem exchange rate better. We all know that it's not going to happen at all.,Negative,256,55
Juul Cat,2020-10-29 13:13:16,"Game is great, for maybe 20 hours. Buy once you get into the ""endgame"" you start to realize that the game is only skin deep. The chests don't respawn, making adventure exp and common items hard to come across in the late game without using up resin, which is essentially mobile game energy and takes a day to regenerate. In order to get new characters you have to spend primogems, which are plenty in the beginning, but few in the end essentially requiring you to put money in for the rare characters",Negative,500,92

Joshua Leon,2020-11-13 02:24:33,Its such a shame that this game has so much potential and yet every time you do a 10 summon you only get one 4* weapon or character. You get it because when you do a 10 summon is a guaranteed 4* weapon or character. They should make the summons with better rate drop because it is just ridiculous.,Negative,297,59
Seung Kim,2020-11-14 17:42:08,"In general the game at launch was polished. I can look past the gacha system since the content itself is accessible for the most part, but the 1.1 patch introduced a bug in the main quest line (Equilibrium) that's preventing many players from progressing and mihoyo won't even acknowledge it.",Negative,292,50
Jonathan Torres,2020-11-12 12:39:33,The game itself its awesome but getting characters is the worst think i have ever seen in any game like this. You rarely get gems to make the summons and when you do get them its 1600 for only 10 summons and its almost always stupid lame weapons. Characters are so hard to get. I have never even gotten a good one even if you waste money on it. Worst summons percenteges ever,Negative,375,73
Seken,2020-11-14 21:17:43,"The game is absolutely fantastic, I love almost everything about it but the only thing that makes this game so bad is that it lag so much, before the update everything was almost perfect there was just a few bugs but now i can't even get more than 5fps with the lowests graphics",Negative,278,53
Jordan McKittrick,2020-11-11 06:56:25,I will gladly change my rating to 5 stars once the resin system is totally overhauled. The game deserves a good rating but this resin system is garbage. It limits almost everything you can do so once you have spent your daily amount you are done and can't grind the materials you need. This is a game I would play long term but needs some help. The amount of free currency you earn for pulls is horrible compared to most gacha games and the 5 star rates are horrible,Negative,466,89
shane walch,2020-11-10 10:21:51,Game worked great since launch. Only had the occasional problem with freezing. Now it crashes literally every time I start it to the point of having to hard restart my phone. It's completely unplayable at this point. (Not that I was getting much more than 15 minutes of playtime out of it anyway due to lack of content) Playing on a pixel 3 and this is the only app that has problems. Fix the game and I'll fix my review.,Negative,421,80
Saipan,2020-11-11 08:51:13,"If you update the app and require the whole game too be downloaded again (5.6GB) each time, I better quit the app right this moment.

Daniel Ferrusquia,2020-11-04 23:08:53,"I play this on pc but wanted to put this review here - Resin (this games stamina system) is poorly implemented, it's incredibly slow to refill and running anything will very quickly drain it -Paid currency is insanely overpriced, cheapest option wont get you even a single summon -Gacha rates are the worst that ive ever seen, 0.07% and the game is really stingy with it gacha currency as a reward, you need about 1600 to 10 summon, the game only gives you at best 20 at a time, more likely 5 or 10",Negative,498,94

Virtual Person,2020-11-11 18:21:19,"Okay after giving the game a go since its release here's what I can say: It's a game made by developers who are known for poorly optimizing their game resulting in moderate to severe lag in a lot of phones which is the case here, gameplay gets repetitive very quickly P2W wall is high the story is average. Combat is very clunky and very unresponsive (same issue with other MiHoYo games). Sadly the game is 90% hype. In reality the game is average at best.",Negative,456,85
Crystal,2020-11-04 04:52:26,"This game is money hungry. The developers are aggressive and will stop at nothing to rip every last dollar out of your wallet. It hasn't even been a few months since the game launched and the devs haven't been generous to its players. Even its wishing system is not that great. They don't even give you free pulls, unlike other popular games of the same genre. They also don't have a login incentive, just to make people open the app. Sure, you could do the commissions, but even that is not a lot. Don't download this game unless you're ready to pay to win (p2w).",Negative,564,105

Rudransh Kulshreshth,2020-11-11 11:30:06,It asked me to update and then when I did it all over again is downloading 5.6GB of gamedata which is so stupid. Please fix this problem. Not everyone can download 5.6Gb again and again after every update. This is so disappointing because now I just have to stop playing because I ain't wasting my internet again just because of an update.

My experience is repeatedly pulling supports and healers and not having a core DPS character to do the Abyss with, which makes for a very negative play experience. I'm having to make do with the main character in Geo spec, which would be ok except for the incredibly frustrating bug which makes enemies ""stuck"" on top of your meteors and then they reset from low hp back to full, which screws your run completely because it's a time trial.

Mythic Nova,2020-10-23 11:32:42,"The game could be so much more. It could be amazing on every front, but the developers refuse to allow their game to grow. The resin system (the system that limits how much content you can do) Is completely killing the game. It was designed in a way so that when a new player is playing, they wont interact with it. But as soon as you hit the Content wall, the game becomes unbearable. Once you explore the map a single time, you're forced to spend resin to level up characters, artifacts, ascension materials, weapons, etc. This all costs RESIN which is capped at a 120, 8 per minute. everything in the game cost 20 resin or more. this means you're on average getting 15 or so minutes of playtime before having to wait 16 hours for it to refill. This problem is suffocating, as it would take months to level new characters due to chests not giving enough exp and mob exp being pitiful. And the reason this game is getting a one star review is that the devs spit in our faces and are doing NOTHING to fix the issue. They're increasing the cap from 120 to 160, but not the regen rate. You're still only getting 15-20 minutes of gameplay, but now you can do it every 21 hours instead of 16. It's a sad excuse for a fix and is the exact opposite of what everyone was asking. The game limits you too much and isn't enjoyable after you finish the already shallow, small world that quickly becomes extremely empty and barren. Even as pretty, beautiful and well crafted the game is, the developers wanted to monetize it too hard and are getting too greedy. The game is just NOT worth playing in its current state. Come back in a few months maybe, we'll have to see if im allowed 10 minutes or less of gameplay then.",Negative,1708,321

However you also spend that stamina on runs to get materials needed to improve your characters and get gear. for some of those runs you need to wait 5 h 20 min to do 1 run. This discourages you from wanting to pull a new character because it'll take LITERAL WEEKS to bring one character up to the level of your current team.

You will be finished with all the story telling content in a matter of hours of active gameplay. Leaving the only thing for you to do is the abyss a dungeon system that is reset bi-weekly and 15 minutes of grinding through the resin system.,Negative,495,90

The energy recharges so damn slow (hence the low daily playtime), you would need to repeat this for up to a whole year to have enough to fully gear your active team.

Having almost everything gated behind Resin turns what could be a great game into something disappointing and borderline frustrating. I'm not saying they should remove Resin completely, but at least give players SOMETHING to do. Currently, if you want content you're either forced to spend money or wait many hours for resin to refresh. Mora (gold) farming, materials farming, artifacts farming, experience grinding, everything is tied to this system. This would be fine if Genshin was just a gacha game, but Genshin Impact aspires to be more than that, it claims to be an Open World Action RPG. On another note, their gacha rates are also pretty bad, even when compared to other similar titles that use the same system. At least they have a pity system, but with a rate of 0.6% it takes up to 180$ for a guaranteed random 5 star (legendary). Yay I guess? Overall, lots of potential here, this game certainly caught a lot of attention and can develop a dedicated audience that goes beyond the gacha niche, but it's up to miHoYo to decide what to do with it.

croco Q,2020-10-07 14:42:21,Monetisation is very predatory. While on surface there are no glaring paywalls - if you want a character you need to loosen your wallet and pull out your credit card. It literally takes thousands of dollars to max out your character. If you are someone who gets easily addicted or don't have a budget then stay far away from this game.

The energy system is also one of the worst I've experienced, you can drain it in under 10minues and all you have left to do is run around opening boxes that give you meager experience and loot. While I understand that companies aren't charities and need revenue on an otherwise well executed game, the returns on spending any money here seem to be terrible. Watching people spend $2k+ for a single five star is kind of eye opening. I also hope if they do fix things its retroactively or they start showing the player base some generosity.

There is little significance to exploration, because you don't need most of the things in the field. Food isn't necessary to progress in the game. Enhancing gear just feels like an annoying obstacle that you have to get through just so you can keep progressing. And, perhaps the most irritating thing is how clunky the transitions from activity such as swimming, climbing, etc. are to going back to walking/combat, especially during timed challenges. In fact, it's almost like the climbing time challenges are showcasing how terrible the game is at guessing when the player wants to climb up and when the player doesn't want to climb up. It's irritating during normal exploration as well since you'll randomly climb up trees for no reason. Not to mention, gacha rates are abysmal. I'm still going to play this because I like gambling with free resources, but to say that I like this game just because I plan to play it daily would be a complete utter lie.",Negative,1118,189

The reason I give the game 2 stars is because there is no controller support on the mobile version. I would happily throw money and time into the game if this is addressed in a future update.

With such low rates, this game has the audacity to require 6 dupes to max a character. The energy system doesn't have much you can use to replenish, making it difficult to progress throughout the day. Basically, this game is unnecessarily stingy with everything.

Gameplay is fun, but the camera angles are awful, I feel like I'm fighting for control of the perspective more than enemies, it's always automatically panning into the ground or trees mid combat which completely blocks my view of what's happening, very annoying. And the game is f2p in the sense that you don't need 5* units to do well, but the game is very stingy with currency and pull rates are horrendous",Neutral,499,89

But the HORRIBLE camera and aim controls (touch and gyro) on mobile seriously detract from an otherwise amazing game. The camera constantly zooms in while running so you have to zoom out again every 5-10 seconds, and moves around randomly in combat often blocking your vision with obstacles or facing away from enemies entirely.

Supposed to give you 90 primogens every day for 30 days, but you only receive them if you log in, if you don't log you don't get the reward and they don't tell you that.

angelyrique Hibs,2020-11-02 01:18:50,The game itself is really amazing and I would recommend it to anyone I know. It just that it randomly crashes and when I teleport to some places the lag kicks in. I have a latest phone with 4gb ram and 64gb storage so I think the game itself has bugs. I appreciate that the game itself is free but can you please fix this issue? Once it fixed I will changed my rating to 5 star. Thank you so much game developers.,Neutral,413,83

Jamie Macdonald,2020-11-03 21:03:30,"The game itself is big and open world but at a certain point the game ends and it's a rather abrupt end to the story, it feels more like 10% of the game is released at the moment and it would be better if you had more to do at higher levels as all I do now is log in to do commissions then log out because theres nothing else to do in the game.",Neutral,344,75
Svavar Skuli,2020-11-02 06:20:53,"Good game, but uncomfortable to play as it heats up the phone, lagging isnt a major issue but i have run into them. Honts aren't always apparent and many bosses need unique approaches, making it annoying to figure out, but after you've figured them out they can be fun. The game itself is a very grindy game where you have to play every day if you want to make any progression, skipping a day every now and then won't slow your progress all that much though.",Neutral,458,86
lyka cuneta,2020-11-02 15:29:11,"It's a great game, honestly. If not for the restrictions brought by the resin system, I would give it 5 stars. Hope they work on the wish system as well. Probably have the weapons and character summonings in different banners since it's really hard to get those gems for wishing. Most players with abysmal luck in summoning rely on the pity counter and if this resets because of the untimely summoning of a 5 star weapon.. it's quite the heartbreak. Hopeful to see some improvement in the future.",Neutral,496,88
Jose R,2020-11-08 18:54:35,"Overall, it's an enjoyable game if you go about not spending any real money on wishes as the energy (resin) system and major lack of materials for leveling up characters and weapons eventually are just not enough. Rewards do not scale well, if at all, as you progress your adventure rank. As such you'll eventually find yourself wasting your already limited energy on ley lines every day once you have exhausted the games questline and high tier chests just to level that new 4/5 star you rolled.",Neutral,496,87

Sensitivity on my phone is not going well chara's not attacking when doing a charge attack(sword), bow user can't move while aiming.

The music and visuals are also divine. My only problem is that the game crashes a lots of times before you can play it, and even then, it will still crash after an hour or two. There are also some optimization problems regarding some dialogue and quests. An example of this is when you're about to enter a temple with kaeya. Only one option won't crash the game. Fix the crashes.",Neutral,500,90
Ryan Chan,2020-11-01 07:28:45,"Great graphics, but its short lived when the hero draw rate is trash.

Jordan Nichols,2020-11-11 02:51:48,"This game is easily 5 star, if not for the fact that the Android version doesn't support controllers. This, to me, is a borderline unacceptable oversight, as the game can be extremely difficult to play with touch, obscuring so much of the display. Since there is apparently no future in Xbox for this game, I feel very left out since I would have to purchase a PS4 or PC to properly experience the game.

Halfey Halphstein,2020-11-11 15:03:32,"As someone who have spent hundreds or maybe thousands of hours in Skyrim and NieR Automata, I think this game is a wasted potential due to limited attack moves (no dash attack, no jump attack except for the one you execute when you're about to land from gliding or jumping from higher ground).

It's far too limited, takes too long to unlock, and ultimately just missed the mark. Don't expect to go on an adventure with your friends. The experience is more like being an AI companion to the host with the added negative that your presence prevents them from doing quests.

Vimukta Uniyal,2020-11-11 12:52:28,It is amazing although it is a copy of Loz botw but it has its own traits the reason I've not given it five stars is because it occupies a lot of space.,Neutral,152,33

Hyun,2020-10-25 12:06:56,"If we're talking about the story, the open world, graphics, and music, this game is one of the best considering the absence of a paywall. The wishes is a hit-or-miss: the gacha system is the same as other anime-ish titles. The problem, however, comes from when you finally reached ar30-ish. This is the start of the incredibly steep slope: the resin system is not polished and so, grinding and farming gets significantly harder. I really hope you guys'll buff the resin system a lil bit more :)",Neutral,494,87
Floyd A√±o,2020-10-26 10:37:44,All is good and all is outstanding. The graphics and the storyline is excellent.

The gameplay is solid with the combat being fun, the gear progression having a strong focus and exploring the world and findings is collectables is fun.",Neutral,499,94
heneral tango,2020-10-19 00:43:00,Great game but for now i'll give it a 3 star. If ever you would consider adjusting everything for us android users that's only on mid-tier phones then that would be very much appreciated. I have a vivo phone with 4gb ram but still it crashes the game every 2-3minutes. Please do something about it if there's still a way. Not many players have decent phone to play this game which is a total bummer. I'll gladly spend money on this game if you could do something about this. Thank you,Neutral,484,91
HITHESH VENKATA,2020-10-28 14:24:59,"I just loved the game, graphics, controls and story, but the reason why I'm giving a 3 star is due to the gacha system and its mechanics. Look, I know how this gacha works and have played many such ones before, but the drop rates and the pity system are really subpar. Even if they have got a pity system, the gems required to summon are really hard to get for a f2p like me. So except for the summoning rates and costs, this game seems very good.",Neutral,447,88
Yuki Wiharja,2020-10-30 16:55:33,"genshin impact is probably the best RPG games for this year, but the mechanism to level up characters is sucks. the main resource to upgrade char level is to spend resin which takes so long time to regenerate. to build 1 char, perhaps 1 or 2 weeks needed, and not to mention the repetitive dungeons you have to go through. at the beginning, it was very enjoyable, but then after mid to end game, it is boring",Neutral,408,77

But I was wrong Since there is no pvp in the game. Great combat, fantastic world. Don't know what to say its just great. 10/10 Update: when u get far in the game like adventure rank 40 and more the game is so hard and so p2w. Rates are pretty bad and when u don't have a good character ur gonna struggle with some of the content in the game",Neutral,489,96
Danny G,2020-10-26 19:29:40,Needs Controller support!!! This is a great game especially considering at a mobile game. I love everything about it but its just a real bummer there's no native controller support. I'd really like to see that in an update. Currently using Octopus to have my own controller overlay but it just isn't the same as real controller support. Please add and will change to 5 stars.,Neutral,375,66
Paul Murphy,2020-10-23 19:17:26,"It's a beautiful game, but the lack of controller support is inexcusable. This type of open world game needs a controller to make it fully playable and enjoyable.

Michael Holoubek,2020-10-26 02:39:49,So the game is really quite good. The combat and exploration are amazing. However as of right now the end game is not good at all.

Dr Andracca,2020-10-18 14:59:08,"Mobile needs controller support and the monetization model needs work. See Warframe where you can straight out pay for characters up front, or grind for them in missions.

Events aren't that fun to do. The characters look nice and the gacha seems okay but it's just not all that enticing to play unless you have a console or PC.

I've reached the endgame and it is disappointing no content whatsoever but u can still do stuff like get gems from exquisite chests and above or grind your characters level & equipments. The rewards isn't enough to upgrade all 4 units in equal footing just reach the others. Which is dumb because u need the resources to progress ur account. I hope they increase the rewards by 4 times. The good thing is u can solo some elite bosses in your current stat.,Neutral,490,90

Rob Sage,2020-10-24 01:17:38,Fun gameplay until you hit Endgame. You get 120 resin per 16 hours of realtime that high level players burn through in about 10 Minutes of grind at the most. Then you need to spend a lot of money or wait until it refills. This makes endgame a paywal and timegated crawl that just makes you play less and less. Without that system the game would be an easy 5 stars,Neutral,363,71
Jaron F,2020-10-28 02:11:39,"Let me start by saying this is a fantastic game, rivaling games that huge companies make and promote for years. Unfortunately, this is pretty shell wrapping a predator gatcha game. If you think I am joking, keep in mind this game only has a handful of 5 star characters and youtubers who spend thousands a week on the game have yet to max them out. The slowing grind of resin also presents a problem and a wall to leveling up the characters. I enjoy this game and hope it can rise above this hinders",Neutral,499,94

Chong Lao Yang,2020-11-11 10:24:04,"Great game paired with beautiful graphics however mobile doesn't as of yet support controllers so touch screen controls are clunky.

Guoji Yu,2020-10-21 08:31:51,"Genshin Impact feels like it's still in beta with the current players testing the game. It has a nice big world to explore and initially has a lot to do in the world. It reminds me of Anthem, where they limit the amount of quality drops you can get with resin so you don't just stop playing the game. It won't take that long casually to complete all the content in the game even with all the artificial walls designed to keep you from progressing too quickly. The cool thing about the game is that you can play for 30 minutes a day and complete the dailies, which caters to a lot of players who don't have that much time to play and can enjoy the game in short bursts. The bad thing is that it's literally the only thing you can do unless you want to spend money in order to get meaningful results. miHoYo is known for supporting their games long term, with a bunch of their older games still getting updates. They are all by design made for you to gamble though as are most gacha games out there. Spending a little but of money doesn't get you much and you are better off buying Breath of the Wild or Monster Hunter World. The combat system doesn't have that much depth, only 2 bosses in the game that you can do once a week, slow progression to level up and fight the same things over and over, the need to gamble for duplicate units, layers of randomness for artifacts for the price of doing domains all make Genshin an okay game unless you have disposable income when you reach the late game.",Neutral,1496,285

Danny Mui,2020-10-13 21:09:27,"The first 20-30 hours are a joy, feels like a single player game exploring and interacting in a beautiful open world. When you have quests available for upgrade materials (xp books, gold and fodder) upgrading your characters is that not bad. At the higher levels getting the materials, xp and gold is time gated through their resin system so this experience turns into a mobile game, play 30 minutes and out. Oh, you can binge on a weeknight while the grandparents are watching the kid? Sorry, same 30 minutes because you're capped at 3 elite fights or 6 ""dungeon"" runs for that 120 resin. Most of the higher level ""domain"" is just a room where you fight a few round of enemies and then collect the treasure if you have enough resin. The coop experience is not complete now, it's not a feature, it's only a bolt-on. If you want variety of skills and team composition, don't look at this game. You get a base team + Noelle guaranteed, then the rest is the slot machine (gacha). Guess my brother and I are spoiled by Coop and loot play in Borderlands and the Diablo and real MMOs like FF XIV that we're just going to play Path of Exile now until Mihoyo decides what kind of game they want to turn this into. 5 stars for the initial 20 hours, subtracting 2 stars for monetization gates.",Neutral,1283,236

Even the touch controls aren't very customizable, as I'd like to be able to change the locations of the joystick and buttons.

No reason to care about elemental combos because you can't afford to build all of your characters, you have to leave some behind. Resin is ruining the game.",Neutral,474,88

Ryan Martin,2020-10-06 20:44:37,"This game is visually incredible, game play is fun and fluid and of the overall content of the game I have absolutely nothing bad to say. My only reasoning for the 3 star rating is when you get to the point of farming, they limit how much you can do daily with refresh limits.

Luck Yeung,2020-10-04 20:26:58,This game runs terribly on my HTC 10. There should be a hardware check or some form of benchmark before letting you decide if you want to perform the 6GB download or not. The intro could barely play freezing most of the time and the game looks blurry. Otherwise from what I've managed to play it looks promising.

Averyne,2020-10-12 18:47:38,This game is amazing initially but when you play for quite a while it shows many problems in its progression and balance. The combat and exploration is very good. The story is pretty meh but all cutscenes and dialogues are unskippable. The biggest problem in this game is most of the endgame progression is tied to gacha. SSR weapons are ONLY available in gacha and dupes system in this game provides your characters with ridiculously big buffs but at later dupes so it's pretty much straight P2W.,Neutral,497,87

Plextum,2020-10-16 18:14:52,"This game is so good and a rare gem!

Joseph F,2020-10-08 18:54:49,The amazing reviews likely come from users who have yet to reach the wall of progress post-storyline; who have yet to be exposed to the ridiculous gate for ascension mats/gold/exp books.

To Those Who May Be Concerned,2020-10-14 23:08:32,"If I played this on Steam, I'd give it a 10. The combat and Story are great, but the controls and camera are clunky.

Jesse Savilla,2020-10-01 10:19:41,The gameplay is SO good. But there is just one problem. The amount of primogems you get for a quest is too low for the price of wishes.

My biggest problem is how you advance your adventure rank. To get from adventure rank 25 to rank 26, you have to beat this one boss that is basically unkillable in the time frame the game offers.

Unfortunately there's one big disappointment: You don't really get to play with others and this evolves more into a single player game. The multiplayer is almost completely left out which I personally find super disappointing and means the 2 missing stars from me. Apart from that, I can only recommend it to everyone.",Neutral,472,81
Nanda Utama,2020-11-11 18:58:23,"For a casual, free 2 play game... it's the best game handheld device could offer! But, for a gacha game... this is WAAAY worse than what you would expect.

Taylor Rousseau,2020-10-25 14:49:05,It a beautiful game and I love it. But what really kills it for me and my excitement for this game is the resin system. The resin system only allows me to enjoy the game for about 4-11 mins because I have to wait until my resin fills back up to collect items that I would need to basically level the characters and weapons. The resin system either needs to be faster and increased or get rid of it entirely and let players enjoy the game without this limitation.,Neutral,462,89
Brandon,2020-10-28 09:12:16,Played for about 40minutes then my galaxy S9 prompted a notification that the phone was too hot and I wasn't able to charge my phone. I had to shut down the phone for 20 minutes to cool it down and charge it. The game might run decent if not charging but battery life won't last long when not charging and playing this game. Since I can't charge my phone and play at the same time I uninstalled. Besides that the game was good for the 40 minutes I played.,Neutral,455,89
Naomi,2020-10-31 03:11:23,"I really love this game but I've found a bug on the Luhua Landscape quest where I can't find the paintbrushes and paints that are supposed to be near the fast travel point (the ones from the black and white sketch). I've installed the game on my pc as well just to see if it could be fixed by changing devices and I've found that the issue persist, please fix it, I really want to get done with that quest and need the stone for the eyes of the guards. I'll change this to 5 stars once it's fixed.",Neutral,497,99
Russ Bernhardt,2020-11-02 23:08:16,"Developers really need to add controller support. Graphically and game play are stellar. I really really like this game, but I really hate touch controls.

Really really need controller support.",Neutral,350,62
Manish Kumar,2020-11-10 10:53:45,The game itself is a great game and and looks amazing. However the resin system is so limiting that you can only grind for 30 minutes max. I would like to play the game but the game itself doesn't allow that. Playing for those 30 minutes feels great but I'm only allowed 30 minutes due to this system. The gacha system is not great either but i guess a free game needs to make money somehow.,Neutral,391,76

I'm AR 30, I've played other gacha games before. 0.6% for a 5 star is absolutely insane. Even 4 stars (good 4 stars) are hard to come by.

K A,2020-10-22 00:56:49,"Beautiful and fun, but... the games ""resin"" (stamina) system makes the game virtually impossible after level 35 or so. You start running out of things to do except for fighting bosses and collecting those rewards, which is gated by resin. Gameplay only lasts 15 to 25 minutes to run out of resin. This means you start running out of character EX materials, Ascension materials, in game money, etc. You have to start choosing what small amount of resources you can collect any given day.",Neutral,486,84
Sagnik Dutta,2020-11-05 11:03:38,So the only reason I gave it three stars is because it's too much pay to win. For F2P players half of your day is spent in grinding for those wishes and at the end we don't even get a character if we buy 10 of those . I usually can only spare an hour into this game and most of the time goes away in completing daily expeditions . I like this game a lot but it's forcing us to spend half of our day into the game .,Neutral,414,90
Lawrence Agulto,2020-11-08 22:19:59,"The game is quite fine. The open world design is superb but, to me it lacks something. Even if you can explore the map you feel alone and sometimes it feel repetitive and boring. The gameplay is also fine the leveling of characters are quite slow. The gacha system is solely based on luck. It is really difficult to get a 5 star character.",Neutral,339,64
Sooya Sauce,2020-11-15 18:03:04,"The game is great but the graphic settings needs to be more flexible. Like when you put the graphics on the lowest the game will just be blurry and thats it. You can still see the details on most objects. I know this game is meant to be played by high end devices but don't you want your players to grow?

World looks good but is mostly empty. Game would run fine on normal graphics settings then crash when I got to a major town. Dropped graphics to lowest and it wouldn't crash in town but would still crash randomly.

A N,2020-10-16 14:28:50,"Fixed my review to make it less chunky. But anyways, I love the game, I really do. It has great art and gameplay and characters. But first, the gacha system is predatory as heck. With a .6% rate for a 5 star and only a pity at 90 rolls, ie $270, and you're not even guaranteed the chara you want. Next, the stamina system is sad. Recharging at a glacial 1 per 8 minutes. And everything requires resin- from lvl up the charas in your roster, to ascending them, to getting money (which you need to lvl up and ascend) and basically just to progress your party. This is heavily restrictive and there's not much else I can say other than feeling the creep of knowing I have and want to grind and yet not being able to.",Neutral,713,138

Valcrist Drake,2020-09-28 13:33:57,There's no denying that this is a beautiful game. There's also no use complaining about gacha anything on a mobile platform. Unfortunately this game is wasted on its chosen platform. The graphics will shut down anything but a flagship phone and it follows the control scheme the requires smearing your fingers all over the screen of an (often) $700+ device. I would happily purchase this on another platform like the Switch; it's incomplete on a phone.,Neutral,452,76

Jillian Dayao,2020-11-16 10:43:37,"Beatiful game with abyssmal gacha rates.

Sure game can be played with free heroes but that does not validate the super high top up prices and terrible rates.

Th3 Wuba,2020-11-17 03:15:00,Game is great love playing it would give 5 stars if the gacha system was better It just seems that putting the money towards the gems is not worth it would be better if the gems were worth more primogems than just one like a system of 1 for 2 would be better than just the 1 for 1.

It plays like the other titles the publisher is known for, a hack and slash system with a few enemies that you spend your time on at a time. It has a cooking mini-game so you know its worth spending time on. The only thing holding back the 5 star is the camera angles. Ill be in the middle of a fight and suddenly all I see are bushes or I jump down 5 feet and im looking straight down.",Positive,500,101
Golden Eli,2020-11-15 18:50:06,"I really like this game and have it on my PC as well. My problem with mobile version is that it lags a lot. I try doing challenges that are given in commissions and game starts lagging while timer is still going on. This also happened during battles and events as some of them didn't even play, it was just black screen. But overall I'm quite surprised I can even play game this big on my phone.",Positive,395,77
Sailor Moon,2020-11-12 17:35:05,"My experience in the game so far has been great. The map is big for a mobile game and there are lots of places to explore and discover. I love how they added CO-OP, but it has a level requirement. Changes that needs to be made - Character switch placement (horizontally on top right for more camera movement space), more ways to get Intertwined/Acquaint Fates for free-to-play players. It'd be easier if players can arrange the whole user interface in settings (small screens)",Positive,476,83
i hired a samurai,2020-11-12 18:54:28,"it's a really nice game. beautiful graphics and all but i was really dissapointed with the co op system. like you couldn't play with friends who are in different servers. at least you could use a warning before giving the player the option to choose the server? like ""heyy just a reminder that you can't play with players in different servers in co op mode,""",Positive,358,65
Fira rain,2020-11-12 23:29:50,"Tis a great game, was looking for this kind of game for some time. Graphics look good but its anime like can Trow some poeple of, not me as i like it. The controls of the game is easy enough to use. But i dont feel that i have a party with me. Would like to see them walk around me. The initial load time of this game is like hell. Mayby something with my phone? Dont know but its long. As i like to short moment a time, dont have much time on hand. Would like to see that optimised.",Positive,483,101
Silent _ Kill _ Zone,2020-11-12 22:30:18,The game itself is great and the story line is epic but i really hate it when it suddenly crashes i don't know what seems to be a problem cause my internet is playable at 90ms and my storage is about 5gb more just want to play it continously but this is the only thing that is blocking me from the game. Is this an issue with the game or my phone? Hope you'll find a way to make it a better experience.,Positive,402,83
Zachary Arganosa,2020-11-10 09:35:20,"Amazing experience so far! However, the audio keeps being weird and stuttering. Also, to add on, I think the Resin count is too low and the time it takes for Resin to regenerate is too long. As it stands now, it takes 16 hours for 120 Resin to fully regenerate and it would be even worse if the resin count increased to 160 with changing the time per resin. Please fix this! Immediate five star otherwise.",Positive,405,76
Bloody Mugetsu,2020-11-11 06:52:30,"Really cool game with plenty pleasant features such as elemental reactions and the ability to affect world thanks to them or the fact that you can kind of go anywhere you want to, climb every mountain and look for treasures scattered across everywhere. The only flaw I find is that playing this game on platform other than PC is pretty painful, but maybe it's just me - still playing on my phone when I have some spare time and can't access my PC though. Would've rated it as 5 if it was PC review.",Positive,498,94
Marshii,2020-11-12 02:52:31,"It's a nice game, with stellar graphics. I can't say much about it yet. It's a little laggy at times. The thing I find super annoying is how I had to purge everything on my phone in order to have enough space to play this. I hope it comes out for the switch soon, because I'd really like to play it on that and prevent my phone from exploding because of how much gb this game requires.",Positive,385,77
My Vu,2020-11-11 16:10:48,"After the update 1.1, I can no longer play the game on my Samsung Note 10+. Apparently, this game is too much for my phone to handle rn so it keeps crashing. Idk if any other smart phone experiences the same problem but I'm starting to rule out playing this game on phones. Such a shame, because most of the time I only have my phone with me and not my laptop.",Positive,360,72
ClubDuck,2020-11-10 23:18:15,"Story spoilers: You get to choose to play as the brother or sister at the start of the game. But the devs put in the wrong character voicelines sometimes, so you can have an NPC call you man even if you're a female. Doesn't sound like an issue until Kaeya tells you about the Abyss Order, and their leader, a man called ""The Prince"". Problem is, Kaeyas voiceline said ""The Princess"", while the text said ""The Prince"". Meaning that the leader is my kidnapped brother. What a lame way to be spoiled.",Positive,497,92
Corbin Barrera,2020-11-13 01:19:47,"Really Fun The gameplay is enjoyable (despite the issues with the camera) & can be suprisingly deep & complex. The storyline is easy to follow & doesn't bother trying to complicate itself, which is a huge plus considering that it's a mobile anime game. The characters are fun, the designs are fantastic, & the loose & fast writing gives the audience a reason to care about the cast. The graphics are also pretty impressive, considering I'm able to run this on Android. Needs more Resin and Primogems.",Positive,500,87
Dagran Halliwell,2020-11-14 20:33:10,"Amazing free-to-play game with loads of content and exploration. Huge open world with many world bosses and epic weekly boss fights you can unlock after completing missions of the main story. The only issue at the moment is the daily energy system (resin). The cap has been raised to 160 as of the 1.1 update, however you still have to wait 8 minutes for 1 resin point, and you need at least 20 to exchange them for material rewards in the game's dungeons/challenges (domains and ley line deposits).",Positive,499,88
Atom Portillo,2020-11-11 08:52:05,"This is one of the best games I've had on mobile, but there are a few significant issues that really impact my experience and prevent me from giving this game full ratings. Resin regenerates too slowly for the time it takes to spend it, some Domains don't reward the materials promised, and certain graphic effects cause severe frame drops. MiHoYo doesn't do a great job responding to feedback, either. I sent 2 support tickets weeks ago and have received no response.",Positive,468,81
Im DeadSeriousG,2020-11-11 07:10:30,"Probably one of the best mobile games I have ever played, I LOVE the art style (and im not much of a fan of anime styles), its got good fighting mechanics, an amazing adventure system, and lots of small-big puzzles hidden throughout the world (just to name a few of my favorite things). Its quite a bit like Zelda, but its not a total ripoff. I'd love to see more weapons for every character type!!!",Positive,399,75
Maple Leafs,2020-11-12 03:25:56,"It's a great game, with an extraordinary in depth lure and an interesting story. Plenty of good playable characters (a good handful of waifus), and great dungeons and game play. However it is a hassle to get these characters and it is also a hassle to deal with the resin problem which caps farming. So it does take quite I while to get to higher levels.",Positive,354,66
Chris Buckmaster,2020-11-15 15:11:04,"I've absolutely love this game. I love that I can on the go on my phone and pick up where I left off on my PC, it's gorgeous open world multi player LoZ breath of the wild appearance is breathtaking. My only gripe aside from the terrible rates in the pull system, is that there is no native controller support for mobile. Instead you have to use a third party app to be able to use a controller and also risk being banned... please PLEASE add controller/game pad support for mobile!!!",Positive,484,91
Jamie G.,2020-11-15 23:36:34,Could easily be a five star game despite being a gatcha if it wasn't so hard to level characters after a certain point. There's so much time gating as it is. It's just unexessary. I don't get excited when I get a good new character I get sad because I won't be able to use it for quite a while. This kind of defeats the purpose of a game where you collect characters...,Positive,369,73
Anthony Louca,2020-11-15 02:58:48,"One of the best looking anime/cel shaded games out there with a beautiful world and well made characters, story telling, exploration and adventure. I'm liking the elemental combos/reactions on each other but I'm also finding the lack of a proper lock on mechanic a bit annoying/jarring, to account for this I'd recommend playing this with mouse and keyboard for best control. The resin system (similar to honkai stamina system) also holds back the amount of playability and rate of progression.",Positive,494,80
Kits Falcis,2020-11-01 06:07:18,"Love exploring the world in this game. The Anime illustration is beautiful. The storyline keeps you hooked and will be playing for quite sometime. The music is also superb. I enjoy the orchestra and the asian instruments in it. Unfortunately, ever since I updated the game, there is a distort on the sound. And sometimes a lag that slows me down. I hope this can be fixed cause I am a fan!",Positive,389,72
Calvin Liemowa,2020-11-11 07:29:47,"Genshin Impact takes mobile gaming to a whole new level! The world is beautiful, RPG elements are interesting, and the overall game is high quality. The only bad thing I can say about the game is the bugs that are found in Android devices. There's that cracking sound noises and audio isn't clear. Also, I think graphics can be optimized better for Android devices, especially the mid-tier devices. Gacha wise is fair I think, not too bad as a free to play game. Premiums are bit expensive though.",Positive,497,88
Misaki Chou,2020-11-11 09:03:57,"It's an amazing game and the graphics is gorgeous. However, the fun is only on earlier gameplay. Towards the end, it's getting repetitive and becoming boring. I used to play it so much but there's not much to play anymore so I don't play as much. This is a personal frustration but I'm not getting a 5 star character at all. I almost resort to using my money but I realized it's a waste of money. In my opinion, this game can improve more on better contents and I feel like the story part is short.",Positive,498,96
Telerian3,2020-11-13 01:49:10,This has been a very impressive game. Eautiful artwork done in the cell shading we saw in BotW. But better costumes and ple ty of NPCs to interact with. I look forward to more coming out. My only hang up are control options. The mobile touch is not as tight as I would like and pushes the PC experience more. Like playing a full AAA game on mobile. Let me use my controller and it would be perfect!,Positive,398,78
christopher lewis,2020-11-13 02:27:36,"It's an awesome game, I love it, but I don't know if it's my phone or my reception, but it tends to freeze and slow down fairly often, but when it's smooth it's SMOOTH! the combat, dialogue and animation is a work of art and the constant updates and fixes are worth the wait! A well lovedandhonest company and game!",Positive,315,60
Tom Vampovac,2020-11-15 18:38:52,"Amazing game, extremely well polished, deserves every praise it can get. Wish system is too hard though, for a mobile game it should be easier to get characters and weapons considering we need to get more of the same one to max them out.. Also resin (energy system) is very stingy, dont expect to play much more then 15mins later in the game, and dailys to resolve takes 15ish minutes. After that everything else is gated behind resin (energy) making me want to play something else which is sad :(",Positive,497,90
Geno Cide,2020-11-05 14:20:12,"This game is great! The gameplay, the characters, the voice dubbing, and especially the music, the music in this game is a masterpiece. The only issue is the Original Resins, the one used to claim rewards on domains and open Ley line Blossoms. The recharge of this is insanely long, takes at least 16 hours to fully recharge from 0 to 120, but overall the game is good, it really doesn't require you to actually purchase to become stronger. Looking forward for more updates. Good updates I hope",Positive,494,88
Leevi Heikkil√§,2020-11-10 20:21:16,"The loading screens take forever. 3-6 minutes usually, a few minutes more if there's an update. waiting like that for every single session is quite frustrating, and you have to go through it again if you leave the app. This is a huge problem, which is why I've kinda given up on the game. otherwise, the game is great. I think it's on the list of the mobile games I like the most. The surprise slimes trope is way too overused though, it repeats at every single point of interest.",Positive,480,90
[ MK - V ],2020-11-03 06:05:49,"Near Perfect. I'm in love with how everything synergizes together, from the lovely gameplay, beautiful atmosphere and so much more. I'd give it 5 stars if it's stamina system (Resin) recharged way faster. Waiting an hour for one basic quest is kinda brutal, especially in AR30 onwards. Perhaps you can shorten the Resin recharge to 2/4 minutes (2/4 minutes = 1 resin which equals 10/20 minutes to be able to do the cheapest resin quest) It would really give us more time to grind/play every day.",Positive,495,86
*screams in latin*,2020-11-02 03:02:20,"The game itself is amazing. Wonderful graphics, cute characters, nice storyline, the only thing I have to say is the lag. I have a Samsung A70, and every single time I get to the part where my character and Amber are looking at the sky after the wing thingy, itnfeeezes and the audio cuts out. I don't know if it's a wifi thing, a bug or my phone simply cannot support the game.",Positive,378,73
Martin Villagonza,2020-11-07 09:10:54,"This is a 5 star for the first 40-50 hours. at AR 35+, you'd probably only play this for 15 mins to 30 mins. 1 hr if you collect materials. Lack of meaningful co-op activities as everything is gated by the resin/energy system. As for the Gacha, well rates are low but it's not like you need them 5 üåü to clear abyss/endgame so... spend at your own risk and understand what you are paying for.",Positive,391,76
Hokioi Kirkland,2020-11-09 20:59:36,"Everything about the game is AWESOME, but I'm giving four stars due to the fact I can't even stay logged in for even a minute before the game kicks me out on the mobile version. I don't have a lot of leisure time at home to get it on my computer, so mobile is the best option for me since I'm always on the go. A bit disappointed I can't stay logged in for more than thirty five seconds.",Positive,387,79
Zahaan Khan,2020-11-10 12:37:07,"A great open world experience. However, more variety of monsters to fight with, and a more detailed map, would certainly be appreciated.

Leonhardt Pistachios,2020-11-11 08:44:25,"It's a great game. I love it because it's my ideal RPG. But the update download isn't that ideal. I get it that there's a lot of resources to be downloaded but my internet connection isn't that fast and stable, and I mostly use cellular data so that's why it isn't that great. But that's just me.

Jeffry Akape,2020-11-15 23:41:21,"Very very addictive games...also i love cross platform support on pc and android. Everything you will love about RPG games is here. Char and battle is enjoyable. World map and music will make you never bored even after hundred of hours playing. Gacha rates/percentage could be better though (just 1 5* lol), but f2p is perfectly fine too if you just wanted to be immersed into the world and just enjoy the game. Perfect rating from me.",Positive,435,77
Thomas S,2020-11-11 23:41:19,The game is good but until they add controller support for phones and tablets just play on a computer. The random 5 star characters are extremely low chance and not overly encouraging. Dungeons open at to high level for playing with new players. On top of that the host cannot interact with NPCs while in co-op. However when the running Dungeons with other players it's a lot of fun. I personally find more interesting exploring with other people then alone.,Positive,458,80
Nate,2020-11-15 02:55:08,This game can be entirely free to play. The game suffers from poor gambling mechanics. Each 10 draw has a 4* guaranteed but you can completely draw useless weapons or characters. The packs are not cheap at all. They have a monthly purchase system in place similar to a subscription of about $20 which provides useful items but nothing powerful for the price of $20 or even $5. The game graphics is great and gameplay is fun. The touch controls leads to incidental presses and unresponsiveness.,Positive,493,86
Exel Ft.Yugure,2020-11-12 10:22:20,"These game was absolutely cool. The graphics the gameplay was satisfying. However, its too buggy and so much glitch. Hope the dev fixed it soon after the next update. Edit: The game is getting better after 1.1 and my patient for waiting didnt dissapointed me, the only thing that needs to be fixed was the resin issue, make it so we can get one resin each 5-6 minutes",Positive,367,68
kvan117,2020-11-07 09:34:57,"Absolutely stunning game. Beautiful graphics, art style, world and music. Combat is simple but very rewarding. Especially if you're a number cruncher as endgame rewards you heavily for optimized builds. Solid story so far albeit incomplete There are some glitches and major problems with the game. AR 30+ is where resources get thin and grinding gets annoying. Resin heavily limits what you can accomplish especially as an FTP player. Also drop rates on characters are horrible even for a gacha game",Positive,499,81
Mark Aparri,2020-11-02 23:08:14,"At first I didn't bother with the game, coz I thought it'd be one of those generic hack and slash RPGs that you'll be able to beat mobs and mobs of monsters by just pressing the same button over and over again, I guess I was wrong. This game is great. If you played Zelda Breath of the Wild, the gameplay is comparible to that, however it has its' own twists. My only complaint is the sound. This could be just a compatibility issue with my phone, but the sound has some cracking or static noises.",Positive,497,96

All of the time i used to play is either laptop or pc which is far more powerful than my phone.

Lazarious 542,2020-11-05 05:12:04,Firstly I main on pc side play mobile on the go. The mobile version is good looks good plays good for me just don't like mobile contoles that's why it's a 4* better on pc duh. late game is hard to play on mobile just because of the amount of moving you need to perform but still playable. You will not get every character or weapon unless you spend lots on money but that don't bother me. Unless your really unlucky you will get a good mix of characters. Game is not finished but is still big fun,Positive,496,98
Zer0IX 9,2020-11-04 18:13:59,"Actually I thought this is MMORPG when I first heard about it. But it's fine, the graphics and landscape of the map is definitely very beautiful for a mobile game. The characters design is cute and the storyline alone make me want to see more of this game. The Resin system really make the progress slower and sometimes painful to deal with especially if you're f2p to farm the materials you need but it's still okay for casual player. I hope you can decrease the recharge time for Resin to replenish",Positive,500,91
Regis Fulminata,2020-10-29 23:55:37,"To be fair to the game, it really really is beautiful. The graphics, the open world, the character and monster designs, the weapons and their effects/ attack animations. Everything about the game is breathtakingly beautiful.

Thank you for the beautiful game though hahaha",Positive,488,88
Joseph Zoltan,2020-11-09 03:31:48,"It's a fantastic game, as many other reviews will say. It honestly feels like a love letter to most RPG and Zelda fans; it is very similar to Breath of the Wild but still remains unique enough regardless. It's thoroughly enjoyable if you have the phone capable to run it properly. However, that's my issue. I find that there are frequent frame rate drops. This could very well be as a result of my own phone however at the same time it is slightly irritating. Overall, a fantastic game nonetheless.",Positive,498,90
Levi Core,2020-11-08 21:22:31,"The game is enjoyable and interesting, but it having a gacha based system and touch controls hurts it in my opinion. I wish it was more like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild where you would just buy the game and then it would have new DLC and microtransactions. I really dislike random odds to get new characters. I rather unlock them through game play or just straight up buy them at a fair price Instead. I just hope it comes to the Nintendo Switch soon so I can play it with a controller.",Positive,498,96

Hardeep Kumar,2020-11-12 09:52:54,"It is a humble request to the devs to please implement a better update system as it is quite troublesome to re-download the whole game for every update. Other than than that the game is awesome. The combat system, party system, characters, story all all awesome. And it is fascinating to see devs utilizing the unity to pour out its real capabilities and create such a beautiful world. Also there is an issue with the camera auto panning it always pans in grass, clifs also effects party membr switch",Positive,500,89
Natsume,2020-11-12 04:45:10,"The best open world anime RPG gacha game to come to mobile. A PVE enthusiasts dream. It features a vast, beautiful world that rewards you for exploring, many characters to love, and lots of lore and story to dive and get invested into. It's playable even with the free 4 star characters, and with a simple crafting system it's very accessible. They took everything I hated with MMOs and removed them, giving a next level experience. Now if only the resin refill wasn't 8 minutes per resin... ü§≠",Positive,493,88
Chelly Li,2020-11-13 01:39:06,"Stunning world, beautiful graphics and gameplay, stellar voice acting in multiple languages and I quite like the story as well. Docking a star because the grind in between story arcs (needing to reach a certain level before unlocking the bit) can get tedious at higher levels. Every mmorpg has a grinding component ofc, but I think Genshin could have more diversity in mobs/dungeons to spice it up.",Positive,398,67
Zerzen_YT,2020-11-03 12:17:21,"Too be exact the game is too good for its type of flatform. What i can say is that this game is beyond the league of mmorpg in terms of phone users. the game have a descent physics, quality graphics, breathtaking view, a very good gameplay , eventhough i use low settings the colors everything is good, its a quality game rpg game. its just that the rolls are bad but due to current events they gave away too many benifits even for free to play players. BIG BUT THE DROP ROLL IN GACHA IS A BIG SHT",Positive,497,98
Tony Chen,2020-11-07 15:15:34,"At the beginning the game is fantastic, all great game play, steady progression. However, up until one point where resources are extremely scarce and it takes an incredibly long time just to upgrade something. The stamina system is flawed as it is stupidly slow with high costs when you actually need to use them. Co-op is also very limited, you can't really go on an adventure with your friends. I'd say the game is 5/5 from AR0~AR35 then after that, everything becomes too grindy.",Positive,482,84
Semaj Fisher,2020-11-11 10:22:56,"I was playing free to play and haven't spent money till I finished the main story till this point, so far I have dropped about $80 on this game and am still liking it.

I use an s10 so can connect a ps4 pad and then mirror on the TV, and games like this would be perfectly suited for that scenario.",Positive,348,69
Holum Plays,2020-11-02 03:37:48,"This game is awesome! The characters, the map, the story, excellent! I only have two complaints, my first is about the high prices to buy resin, and my other complaint is of how your adventurer rank progresses quite slow and you have to do a lot of progress before you can continue the main story.",Positive,297,55
Azrul Nizam,2020-11-03 17:34:18,"excellent graphics, very detailed character models, beautiful landscape! however controls is a bit problematic. when fighting facing enemies down on a slope it will force the camera to clip through the ground and hinders visibility. during gliding, when trying to adjust camera i often accidentally tap attack button and perform unwanted drop attack. the placement of the button should be improved. there should also be a forced aim lock that prioritizes aiming enemies in the middle of field of view",Positive,500,80
Brian Carbonilla,2020-11-07 00:12:28,"As much as I want to give this game a 5-star rating, I just can't because of the Original Resin. Cooldown is almost a day, basically when you're out of resins from farming dungeons and ley line blossoms and elite bosses, it's like 4 - 5 runs in dungeons, 3 runs for elite bosses, your done for the day, as much as I want to keep farming, I just can't after. I wish the developers could do something about this before the 11.11 update, I think i'm not the only one who shares this concern as well.",Positive,496,97
Salman Shuvo,2020-11-09 15:55:27,"It's a great game. Probably the best on mobile (unless you're one the battle royal players who thinks there the only pros and everyone is a noob). I know most of the people don't have my problem, but if you could lower the graphics even more that would be great. I play on the lowest setting and it's still the best graphics I've seen on mobile but my phone can't handle even that.",Positive,381,73
Luis Miguel Carvalho,2020-11-11 08:18:40,"HUD needs to be customizable.. and I would love if users had just a BIT more control over the graphics and camera distance.. Love the game, the story, the concept and most of all the dream come true of crossplay even though it's quite limited... would be possible to give friends the ability to also collect geo and anemo stars or whatever? It could be implemented and it would vastly improve engamement with the game.",Positive,418,75
Julien Murata,2020-11-10 10:42:35,"The game is fun to play. Though story progresses slowly and quests get lesser as you reach higher AR. Hope you would be somehow generous on the resins, primogems and drop rate since not all can afford to top up but are very eager to farm. I really like your game and I am looking forward to your better updates. Good luck and God bless developers. Kudos for this wonderful game~",Positive,378,71
INCOD Esports,2020-11-09 15:06:44,"I love the game, the story, the graphics and the gameplay. But the reason why I rated it 4 stars is because it needs a private messaging system for friends, it's a pain to just go to their world to ask if they want to do boss rushes or domains. There should also be a targeting system, some enemies need to be taken out first and having multiple enemies makes it harder. Although I'm satisfied with the game, these improvements will make it better.",Positive,448,84
Jababy,2020-11-11 06:46:40,"Its a good game, open world adventure fighting mobs, easy to do free to play. Only problems are the multi-player is not really advanced and you can't do much with it, and a lack of content later on as you progress. The second issue is because its a new game and we're already getting more content",Positive,296,56
Tapan Kumar Dash,2020-11-13 12:21:24,Overall the best graphics and storyline you can expect.. Its basically like watching a well written anime with awe-inspiring storyline. 4 star because why do I have to download the whole 5.6 GB of game everytime i update... I got a 140 mb update from playstore recently but when i open the game it asks me to download the whole game again. That shouldn't be the way. It's too much waste of data,Positive,394,73
Steven Whisler,2020-11-13 17:56:22,"I'm not very far in but this game seems really solid and fun. It even runs on my lower end phone! I gave it four stars because it desperately needs controller/mouse & keyboard support and even has a key bindings tab in the options that got my hopes up for both. Please add this if possible, I won't say I'm holding the last star hostage(waiting till I play more fully) but this game would be improved a lot by it.",Positive,413,80
Nini mochi,2020-11-11 15:51:08,The game is really good but pretty much expensive for f2p. I have played gotcha games before but this is just too expensive. To secure a 5 star hero you will need $100 and in some other countries it cost much more this month( might be the currency value). So for f2p gamers you have to grind for months and be wise of which hero banner are you aiming for.,Positive,355,70
Shreyams,2020-11-13 19:18:21,Best game I've ever played on a mobile. The one and only thing that's bad on this game is that it's almost impossible to snipe a 5 star character and they give u like only 40 rolls in the start . So people sometimes get really unlucky and not get a 5 star character even after reach AR 45. The gacha duster has very low drop rates and the free rolls u get are just not enough most of the times.,Positive,394,81
J Kenney,2020-11-11 08:47:13,"This has been a blast to play so far! The first 15-20 hours really do feel like a light version of breath of the wild. Eventually around rank 20-something, the time gates and gacha mechanics will begin to pile on, and most of the quests and dungeons become rationed by adventure rank. There are plenty of small side-quests sprinkled around though, to encourage exploration. At that point, it will be up to you how much time and/or money you feel the game is worth investing in.",Positive,477,86
Paulo Santos,2020-11-12 01:17:28,"A beautifull world, well crafted and polished with lots of puzzles and exploration. Everything to be good but ... Rates are absurd, 0.6 is outrageous and your primogems after exploring the world is very stingy. The endgame is spend ""stamina"" in 3 fights and logout. They need to give more incentives to explore the world, more rewards for chests, more resin and coop incentives.edit: after 1.1 they made some positive changes in the right direction",Positive,448,75
Anvay Vishwakarma,2020-11-12 01:41:14,"Overall game is good. But there is minor error in the game... that is after pushing the aim button, only the character (Amber) moves and not the camera. its like the camera is fixed on a single spot. It happens after the update. i cannot enjoy the game. Fix this!!!",Positive,265,50
Bhavik Bhatnagar,2020-11-05 17:21:10,"One of the good gacha games, it's meant to be rather relaxing than taxing unlike highly competitive games. It can be fully single player or coop either go well but for now coop needs more activities. Reason for 1 less star is camera, which automatically pans to a side on attacking which forces me to look through tall grass covering half my screen, makes combat hard! All in all, reminds me of BOTW without being a rip off as combat is pretty diffirent.",Positive,454,83
Mitch Wrenn,2020-10-29 19:42:23,Console level gameplay and graphics with some pay aspects like that of a cellular level video game. It's really fun especially if you've played BOTW. There are striking similarities between the 2 games but I think GENSHIN does a fine job of expounding upon the desirable things in BOTW as well as distinguishing itself from the latter. This game is also cross platform so you can play it on other systems and the PC. I recommend giving the game a try. Just so you know I'll never give a game 5 stars.,Positive,500,92
Jim Uremovich,2020-10-29 18:52:55,Scrap resin and it may save yourselves. We get that you didn't expect such a backlash from people just wanting to play more. Normal phone games people just buy more turns. This however has drawn way too large of a player base for there to be this grabage limitation on use. Also add the ability to map your own controller on PC.,Positive,328,62

With so many resources in the game, it is impossible to ping out all your resource farming routes with just 99 pings, and this problem will get even worse as new regions and resources are added... Please, please raise the ping limit! Better even, remove it all together! There is no need to limit us on pings!",Positive,421,81

I would enjoy if you could play from the beginning with friends, but the fact you have to grind to adventurer rank 16 just steers people away from the game. I can understand an endgame could just join a adventurer rank and power them through the game, but you could make it so World level 0's can only play with other world level 0's. If you would do this, this game would be perfect! Though, it's probably too late to change this.",Positive,472,89
BlckArtst W,2020-11-03 06:18:51,"I enjoy most elements of this game; graphics, combat and story are above board for a free-to-play.

I love this game and would encourage at least a trial by anyone who is interested in a free roam adventure experience.",Positive,423,73
kyle lone,2020-11-11 05:29:52,Best gacha game in the store so far but i just couldn't give it 5 star due to resin system badly need improvement.

An actual Space potato,2020-11-13 11:43:39,This game is beautiful story and graphics wise the gameplay is great the action scenes are great and I had pre registered and was waiting and once it came out I was really impressed and I had also finished the game and felt sad but felt better once I was thinking of the jade palace. I love this game and support you guys! Uh a little update I had this weird problem with childe where he doesn't have a plunging attack in his melee form and its kinda infuriating because I died because of not knowing,Positive,500,96
Om Mishra,2020-11-06 23:32:15,I should have it a 5 star but it's server system is very bad. I am unable to play with my friend in co-op because he is on different server. And to play with him I need to start the game all over again which I hate very much. So I request the team to make common profile on all server. Then I will give 5 star otherwise three then.,Positive,331,70
Marine Paingarden,2020-11-11 09:39:13,"Firstly please stop copying from other games. The more i played, the more i realize you picked character designs, plot and even looks and music from other game. (legend of heroes, tales series, etc) not to mention movement sets and style which ppl already mention about. you already have a good game, not outstanding, but good enough. but 'picking' abit of lotsa game just a turn off. other than that i get a problem w the color and lighting but i guess that's just your style.",Positive,477,86

EVILSKYS,2020-11-15 00:50:49,The game is realy good and I realy like it but the running to on place to another is realy time consuming and I hope you guys make it possible to share your account on the console version of the game or make it where the progress that you have saved to your console and on your phone at the same time so when you are not playing on your console you can just keep playing on you phone because your progress is linked to each other so people don't have to restart all over again from the beginning,Positive,495,99
Rey Fauzi,2020-11-06 11:16:00,"Good game with mainly 1 big problem, the gacha rates. To get a ""guaranteed"" 5* character you need to pull an equivalent of 100$ of gems, which will give you enough gems to get the pity timer at 90 pulls. If you wanna try your luck with the 0.6% rate for 5 stars be my guest. Worst rate in all gacha games I played.",Positive,314,64
Rui,2020-11-07 01:03:23,"As a person that is quite used to the world of genshin, this game is phenomenal. The amazing ost, temtping stories that drives me insane wanting to know more after wards. Usually I skip the stories, but in this game I can't which makes it much more interesting. Game concept is good, though I would say to give more time for genshin to fix the resin issue and basically gacha system. Besides genshin have a soft sport on gacha and you probably already get a 5 star by 70+ rolls. Genshin is anewgame",Positive,498,93
Paige Foster,2020-10-30 09:50:55,"I am playing the game on my ps4 and I absolutely love the game.

Dan Sponenberg,2020-11-12 05:38:44,Game is good quailty. But needs be optimized and fix camera controls. Game tends get laggy and eats up alot ram.

Luis Factoriza,2020-10-29 15:11:41,"I'm loving the game so far, i even got a 5 star character at my first draw, currently this is the best mobile experience i had. Tho i would recommend to lessen the waypoints and add a faster way of traveling without waypoints, like mounts maybe? So it would feel more of an adventure, because currently i feel like theres too many waypoints and we just warp all over the place rather than really travelling, so i really hope that we can feel more of that adventure and travel vibe to genshin.",Positive,492,92
Ej Carl Balaguerr,2020-11-11 08:55:23,It's really good but the only problem I have is the Resin system and the lack of primogem rewards.You should honestly make the achievements give 50-80 Primogems and increase the resin refill from 8minutes to 4-6 minutes but overall it's a really good game has the potential to be one of the best if not the best mobile game.,Positive,324,59
Kate P,2020-11-13 00:14:22,"The game is amazingly made in all aspects, but it's a 4 for me. Despite it's well made story, gorgeous visuals, good organisation, etc, as it goes on you're starting to realise that to have a better chance of getting new characters through wishes you have to pay, a lot of money. In that concept, it's not so much free to play... The rates are so low that even with more than 50 dollars/euro you may still not get the summon you wanted...",Positive,438,83
Deaththe 1blade,2020-11-11 13:33:19,Game is pretty good but there items price went up in a single month u can't change rates so soon it will affect existing player. Aside from that everything is good forget gacha don't roll anything on gacha don't waste money. Also controls are a issue in mobile version cuz u can't customize ur control for better control of ur charachter which is a very big issue for mobile players playing with 2 thumbs is hard if u can play with 4 it gets better,Positive,448,85
Erika Wilcox,2020-11-12 04:59:26,"My favorite pastime since it's release, and my most played game, but the incredibly low rates for 5 star characters, constricting resin system, and lack of ways to earn an amount of primogems plentiful enough that you are able to even have a chance to pull for a 5 star are my only true complaints.",Positive,298,55
respectfull kpop trash,2020-11-13 04:31:50,It really is a great game but I have one complaint I gotta make.

Its Awesome i love the graphics everything looks so beautiful. Also love the character design but the only problem is my phone which is a verh old Sony phone thats why i cant play at max graphics but even if its low its still beautiful. And also it's hard to move in some small spaces like the platform in the windmill. Lovely game, hoping theres more quests and fun thats all. Edit: I was waiting for the 1.1 update so excited but it was all ruined because i need to download a lot of gb again... so what i did was i erased the games data and just downloaded it again.... will it do this every update... needing to download it all over again... im just angry and sad i hope you guys fix this plss... im downloading it again need to wait half a day to finish",Positive,877,171

Shadow Vertigo,2020-11-02 16:39:48,"For a Free2Play game it's pretty entertaining. But I really think the players should have the option to recycle the materials they've used to lvl up a character or weapon, just like in Mobile Legends: Adventure. Just in case I just want to change my play style, and try out different elemental matches. Except for weapon ranks, and for artifacts because artifacts are so easy to lvl up.

Francisko Ferdinanax,2020-11-08 02:35:35,"Please fix this game.. whn ply multiply in this game always broken,, whn near bird or any Animals they freeze and whn try to help friend in thy world to finish the puzzle we can't help to finish the puzzle.. we just can Showing the way to finish the puzzle.. sometime this game can't respond whn we try to burn the Torch, or add some element in puzzle",Positive,351,68
Caleb Arnott,2020-11-14 11:57:23,"This game is amazing and I love playing it. Definitely an easy 4-star. I would rate it a 5, but the game doesn't support controller. Would be amazing if you can make it so you can play the game on mobile and connect an Xbox One controller to play.",Positive,247,49
multifandom bruh,2020-11-11 13:11:48,Sometimes the character disappears but I can still move though. Not just the character but also the objects around disappears. It only appears every time I go near on a specific object. But overall it's still an awesome game,Positive,224,39
Zoe Chong,2020-11-11 18:43:52,This game is great though it is not perfect I really wish that the wishing system will improve and make it easy to get new characters as I am a F2P player. And I wish there was I system where we can exchange characters that we don't want for characters that we want That is all from me,Positive,285,58
Crescendo 101,2020-11-11 06:54:27,While the game is amazing and beautiful it is extremely depressing with its gacha system. You either just suck it up with what you have or whale hard to get characters. They may not even be able to fully max a character either. The energy system starts to slope off once you get to a higher AR.,Positive,294,57
Carlo Dela Cuesta,2020-11-11 15:35:49,"Great game. Love the story and the world. It also doesn't consume all your time because of the resin system. Awesome characters are behind a pay wall though, you have to get lucky to really fully enjoy the game.",Positive,211,39
H4N1Q,2020-11-05 12:26:58,"Slow problem and Freeze problem, When i play 4 co-op on domain, my device will always lag and freeze until i can't play anymore, my cpu is kirin 710 so i need kirin 810 to play smoothly, maybe by adding no skill effects or 360p - 460p would fix the graphic problem on every Huawei Nova 3i user. Thanks for reading.",Positive,314,61
Kaustubh Hudlikar,2020-11-05 19:44:41,"The game itself is super awesome. It's a full package. But I have some issues on my Samsung A71, the sound is cracking and the server is never stable. This reduces the gaming experience. Can you kindly check the issue?",Positive,218,40
Sayantan Pal,2020-10-29 16:08:01,Wonderful game. Perfect resin refill time. Resin cap could be further increased (to around 360). Graphics and gameplay are amazing. Story is okayish. Multiplayer and character/weapon levelling up sucks. Pvp(battle royal/1v1/2v2/1v2) or general progressing the story with friends must be added. On receiving new weapons/characters the xp/items spent on the low tier stuff should be given back in some other form like primogems or even better constellation/refinement for the new characters/weapons.,Positive,497,71
Anh Lam,2020-11-01 17:38:25,"After an update yesterday, It lost sounds in game pls fix it. Cool game but not suitable for any phone. I'm using Note 20 ultra, it lags and hot after a time using üò¢ even with medium setting on graphic. And it takes a long time to download resources on first time launching.",Positive,274,53
Ridwan Choudhury,2020-11-09 00:39:32,"This is one of the best games I've ever played on a mobile device. However, there's one minor problem. Whenever a cutscene comes up, it starts to lag and freeze and I don't end up watching it properly. Other then that, this game is spot on!",Positive,240,46
Axzyl Echavez,2020-11-13 22:58:26,Um i've been playing this for a while now and yeah it is a good game but since the last update which is the childe banner which I have updated and I didn't get to open the game for 2 days now and Right now/today I want to play but it forced me to download again the 5 giga byte the F is this please fix this I really don't wanna uninstall this game please I need an immediate response from game,Positive,394,82
Colin Perry,2020-11-11 10:51:13,"Not a huge fan of the stamina (resin) system and I feel the gatcha is pretty severe with the amount of units, however the game itself is excellent and so is the story. Love the world design and characters, game is doable completely f2p if you want as well.",Positive,256,49
Ivan Pontual,2020-11-11 20:58:42,"Amazing, the very best mobile game out there. I just think it could be more generous with the gacha system. Primogems are very hard to come by, and you need a lot of them to pull for characters and weapons.",Positive,206,40
Andre Acuna,2020-11-13 21:51:58,Its a very good game though my Story Quest of Childe is bot working. It always stops when I am about to defeat the ruin guards also it just turns my screen black. I have replayed it a couple of times and it still doesnt work. Pls help me fix the bug in my game.,Positive,261,55
Anonomius Persen,2020-11-03 15:04:44,"Graphic and interface are just too beautiful, menu ui blend seamlessly with the feel of the game, Since the recent update even my phone with snapdragon 865, get stutter sometimes even on the lowest setting, surprisingly stutter frequency between lowest and highest setting is the same",Positive,284,46
Nahla Maheswari Ardya,2020-11-06 08:39:08,"It's a good game. I love the characters and everything but,, I seriously can't play genshin for more than 10 minutes without it lagging so badly. I have a good WiFi connection and my phone is really new so..",Positive,207,39
Red Rodine,2020-11-04 06:16:18,"One of the best games available, beautiful graphics and a massive world! Only issue I have is that the odds of getting a hero from the gacha side are incredibly low and you'll end up getting garbage common weapons 9 times out of ten.",Positive,233,44
S Mango,2020-11-06 03:59:29,"So far that I have played this game it's really fun and I would definitely recommend it to others, however other than quests the game should let us interact more with characters so we can increase our friendship levels that way.",Positive,228,41
Jeremiah Pasay,2020-11-03 06:51:56,Everything is great except for yhe gacha rates. It's even shittier than their rates in Honkai. It's a good thing there are basically only two rarities here though and that they don't matter much. You can make up for raw stats with pure skill so that's a plus.,Positive,259,48
Chumbo,2020-10-31 00:32:19,"Great game, it is a heavy Gacha game but plays very well. Similar to Breath of The Wild, many awesome characters to play with. It would be nice if they added UI customization for mobile as some buttons are too close together and can mess you up.",Positive,245,47
Fritz Ticala,2020-11-11 10:15:34,"Game feels like a mix between breath of the wild and anime waifu paradise. Honestly, love the gameplay and how much work was put into this game. It is a Gacha game so be warned, but you can still enjoy it without spending a dime.",Positive,229,45
petal On a string,2020-11-11 19:11:28,"the game is fantastic, without a doubt deserves to be in the trends, buuuut it gets a little boring after you beat the game and do everything over and over again like the daily comissions and stuff.Especially leveling up your adventure rank is kinda boring too.",Positive,261,46
Sian Richardson,2020-11-16 04:16:55,"Lack of clarity on storage space needed. If the game needs over 8GB of INTERNAL storage space, this needs to be made clear before installation! Settings menu needs to be accessible from start screen - not after 5/10mins of gameplay. It's a settings menu ffs!! Lack of controller support and fixed joystick position are major flaws. Feedback page is insufficient. Some dialog boxes are too fast. Updates are actually rebuilds - reinstall to avoid issues. Otherwise, great game and very addictive.",Positive,495,81
Wangjon Sawin,2020-11-07 10:46:49,"It was a very fun game multiplayer system is also good , almost every thing is good in this game like GFX, story line but i gave 4 stars because it don't have pvp it could be more better if a pvp is there apart from story line And thanks for making such a good game.",Positive,266,56
Kurina_ Nyan,2020-11-11 19:42:22,"The game is amazing and I love everything about it. But for some reason after the update, when I tried to focus aim, I couldn't really adjust the aim. I don't know if this is just my phone or is it the game, but I would appreciate it if you could check it out, thank you.",Positive,271,56
Egay Atienza,2020-11-12 15:43:35,"It's a godd game overall but the main problem is that after the update, my Amber and fischl can't aim properly, when I try to move the attack button I can't control the aiming mode, please fix it and the game is super lagy in my phone, please notice and fix this",Positive,262,52
Clarissa Yew,2020-11-12 04:28:16,Love the game art and fighting style! I wish we could play freely with everyone like mmorpg. However loving everything in the game so far still. also I wish game had better gacha rate or at least make a 'spark' system where you get 5star after 300pulls or something,Positive,265,49
ahmed gamal,2020-11-10 15:22:47,Realy awosame game Only problem 'on my xiome redmi note 8 pro ' is the loading time . One good thing to add is the ability to move forward and back in camera mode . Also have sort of SOS system so that you actually can ask players to join your world .,Positive,251,53
NIKJA BIRU,2020-11-04 13:37:15,"Just Edited my Review. Really enjoying this game I play this game in ps4, pc and mobile Really cool cross platform game Just love it.

Mal mehmeti,2020-11-08 16:54:08,The game is amazing. I love the animation and the characters. The story is also very good. The only problem is that the story isn't finished so your going to have to wait for the creators to finish it. Otherwise this is an absolutely wonderful game.,Positive,249,46
Juno Manzano,2020-11-08 20:12:55,"It's fun at first but now it's annoying how you can't change characters quickly, you have to click several times first but because of that you can't complete the elemental damage. Ruins the experience.",Positive,201,34
Zomia The Zombie,2020-11-11 04:17:46,Its pretty fun I reccomend it more on pc then mobile if available but its alright on mobile it does have some spots where u have to grind a bit but thats about rank 20 (diffrent to levels) where you'll notice the grind parts with no side quests anywhere is the only reason why its a 4*,Positive,285,57
liam phillips,2020-11-10 11:41:19,Like most of these reviews it's a very good game with good mechanics and design but I have a problem where it restarts my phone when opening the game but when i try again nothing happens and I continue like normal that is the only reason why I give this 4 stars instead of five,Positive,277,55
Pradyum Hazowary,2020-11-12 01:48:56,"This is one the best games I've played and my current favourite.The gameplay is pretty nice and smooth, the graphics are great, the only issue is resin and I'm a free to play player so it's pretty hard to farm materials",Positive,219,41

Please do something.",Positive,299,53
Jor Laffont,2020-11-02 04:23:42,"Great game and graphics. Playable for free if you invest some time farming and have some patience. I would have liked to have more quests, but i cant wait how the game develops in the future.",Positive,191,36

After you done download the 100 plus mb, you need to download 5871.41mb, it's better be good game. OK here's my update on the previous review above, the game is fun, and graphics is really nice, task will be given. Some you need to think but it's not that hard, and you need to work on your level in order to fight the enemy which is in higher level.. Overall, great game.",Positive,493,94
Orchids Blossoms,2020-10-28 19:42:37,It's a great game but it needs ram management optimization and performance optimization on mobile. It's always going freeze even my phone powered by Snapdragon 835. It can be runned smoothly but at some point the game freezing and going crash.,Positive,243,41
Luke Shadows,2020-11-11 14:54:53,A pretty well made game. It's an all rounder and very fun even addictive. But the items in the shop are expensive for Free to Play players. Over all love the game but it take a long time to rank up,Positive,197,41

Yeu,2020-11-15 05:17:28,"Great game! I feel like the only thing that will make Genahin Impact even better is if the development team incorporated a ""Tutorial Menu"" and a ""Cutscenes Menu"" as there is no way for me to review the stuff I glossed over by accident.",Positive,235,44
Veronica Adams,2020-11-12 13:40:03,I love this game so much but recently I tried to switch characters and the game crashed. It completely wiped out my information. I had to sign up again and start the game over completely. I had put a lot of time into this game.,Positive,227,45

Amaya-Chan,2020-11-11 07:01:45,"The game is amazing. The audio,gameplay,graphic and everything itself is amazing. The only reason I giving it a 4 star is that there is a lot of bugs but everything else is amazing.",Positive,181,33
Bakahoe _Katsushit,2020-11-13 10:56:41,"Amazing visuals and experiences but I have a problem with the Childe boss being a little too hard. The problem with this is that since I can't defeat childe I also can't join co op, could you make an option to abandon a quest or postpone it?",Positive,241,47
Khanzada Gaming,2020-11-01 02:03:49,"I am playing this on VivoS1 on low settings , it was working fine and smooth before (with android version 9) but yesterday i updated my phone and the android version upgraded to 10 and now i am facing frequent crashes , frame rate drop and choppy gameplay",Positive,255,48
Khuzema Ahmed,2020-10-31 03:08:32,It's one of the best games I have played so far. The story line the graphics the background music all are awesome but the reason I'm giving 4 stars is that it gets laggy and destroys the whole fun of the game,Positive,208,42

paul dinh,2020-11-11 09:24:03,Really fun has a nice story and everything and non free charcters just make the game easier. Only problem is that all the upgrading gear boss/dungeons are locked behind resin timers and getting new charcters is super expensive. Otherwise I'd give a 5.,Positive,251,43
Ixillius Runeburn,2020-11-11 06:39:14,Amazing base fot a game but the gacha and resin hold it back a bit. If these things are tweaked I'd have no problem with a five star review and sinking some money in beyond the monthly blessing. Avoid if you have any gambling addictions.,Positive,237,45

God Of War Martis,2020-11-11 09:48:57,"It's a great game overall. The downside is, you had to grind a lot to level up certain character. I guess that's the beauty of it. If only the reward's are more promising, i would've loved it even more.",Positive,202,39

Both of them gets sent to the same realm but both are the opposite of good and evil. You go through the story to find one of the other twin while meeting new characters in their story while progressing yours. There are a lot of pros and little cons, the cons mostly consist of how the gacha artifacts are made and some nit picks. The story is great overall.",Positive,498,94

David Barundia,2020-10-28 19:30:13,Really great game i'm actually quite surprised how good it was... - Im starting to get bored of the game no new content while waiting for the next patch and the resin system is really ridiculous...,Positive,197,36
„Åè„ÇìRen,2020-11-02 13:55:35,"I love this game a lot! Though I wish the wishing rates were a little better, and the weapons weren't mixed in with the summoning pool. But nontheless it's a pretty good game.",Positive,175,33
Kira Ray,2020-11-02 15:55:32,"A very beautiful and entertaining game, it only sucks that she's so beefy and you gotta have a strong playing device to handle her. :( My phone only lasts 20-30 minutes before it starts to lag too much for me to play",Positive,216,42
„Äåshu,2020-11-11 22:24:23,the characters and the background are really well designed. the game and stories in it are also quite fun to play. it gets a little boring after you level up or maybe its just me,Positive,178,35
Lenna Tess,2020-11-12 01:52:56,"Great game, even for mobile though I prefer to play on PC because touch screen controls can be wonky and cruel. Would love controller support for any bluetooth gamepad. PC version gets 5/5 but mobile can be painful for me.",Positive,222,40
Ernie Santelices II,2020-11-11 16:09:46,"The game is good so far, however in terms of updating the game it seems that it required to re-download the 5gb over again, it is kind of inconvenient. Need improvement to this issue.",Positive,183,34
Melissa R,2020-11-13 07:34:48,"It's really fun and addictive, I can explore and chest hunt for hours. Just wish it was easier to get the specific characters I want. But no complaints otherwise.",Positive,162,29
ANH Anonymous,2020-11-08 23:00:00,"Quite a lot of bugs! Camera angle freezes sometimes. Co-Op freezes and game crashes. Sometimes even when I've more than half of stamina left, my character would stop attacking for a few seconds! Worst is the heating issue when you play in 60fps!",Positive,245,43
Jericho Puchero,2020-11-10 14:27:33,"Great open world RPG, but I hope they increase character exp on mobs, bosses, and dungeon since character exp is very limited. Also treasure chest refresh, exploring the map for nothing is a complete waste of time.",Positive,214,37
Uci /18,2020-11-08 10:46:37,"Such a beautiful game, with a fluid combate experience, the only problems is the resin, you have to wait 16hrs to fully recharge, and you can only do 5 domains or 3 elite bosses, I found this very annoying.",Positive,206,39
Daniel & Yahel Skowronski,2020-10-29 19:55:40,I really love the game! The graphics are amazing and just the whole game style in general. Just one thing I will say is that the cut scenes are CONSTANTLY lagging and I can't enjoy them. Other then that? Great game!,Positive,215,41
Jose,2020-10-28 23:05:44,"Everything except the gacha primogem aquisition, disappointing events, and horrible energy system, is a masterpiece. The sounds and visuals are really good and crisp. I can't wait to play the updates.",Positive,200,31
Stephen Arellano,2020-11-10 18:13:24,Great game. Althlough the ping is always high shifts between 120 to 300 even when I'm playing solo and the internet speed is stable and fast. Add more features in co op that you can only do in co op.,Positive,199,40
Kevin Perocho,2020-11-11 07:38:20,"The game's open world graphics is amazing, the only problem i had is the control's especially amber's sniping control its to shakey in android phones and please game developers allow us to sell our unwanted items... Other than that its perfect.",Positive,244,41
Lunar F√∏x,2020-11-11 08:30:16,"I love this game but I can't play it anymore ever since it asked me for an update now all I get is ""Server Maintenance: 2020-11-10 15:00 - 2020-11-10 20:00"" is there any way I can fix that? I would really like to further enjoy this game.",Positive,237,47
Timothy Zhang,2020-11-11 06:47:41,I LOVE this game it's just that it is a bit hard to get the gems to buy those character packs and weapons pack. They should make the weapons pack cost less than the other ones.,Positive,176,36
Ahmed naazim,2020-11-14 14:59:07,I like this game a lot but my only problem is it couldn't change button placement if it's changeable my gaming experience would be so great cause lot of time i misclick the attack button while gliding mid air should give some flexibile layout we can play on to our own confident layout,Positive,285,53
Kimberly Singson,2020-11-15 04:00:01,I downloaded this on my phone and played it then I thought why not play on my desktop instead coz of the memory so I able to sync my android data to my pc. I just suck at playing games but this is a great play and I will never buy to get something with real money.,Positive,264,57
Benjimen Sellers,2020-11-15 12:45:12,Great game!!!! Graphics and controls are good. I only recieve a lag during some cutscenes but hitting the recent button twice to minimize and bring back the app corrects the issue. Awesome job with this!,Positive,203,35

Jackie F,2020-11-11 17:42:34,"good story good gameplay good control good mechnism. would be better if players can set the button locations.also would be better if players can lock equipments that player want to keep, so that they wont accidentally be consumed when upgrading equipment",Positive,254,41
Khristian Vonnie,2020-11-15 21:08:17,"Great game I love it, but I think the only problem of the game is the pity system for five star char/item, please mihoyo can you fix this? Also I hope someday you'll give us more primogems.",Positive,189,37
Jericho D,2020-10-30 05:21:14,"Clearly a Breath of the Wild clone but is actually better than the original. I occasionally experience weird popping noises on my Note 10+. Upon googling, a lot of people are getting it on their Samsung devices as well. Hope this can be resolved asap.",Positive,251,45
Kurt Labrador,2020-10-28 22:07:57,Its a beautiful game but the ping or the wifi on this game is high and its making the game a little bit laggy. Please fix the high ping from the servers because I can't play with my friends well when I am always lagging.,Positive,220,45

peanut,2020-11-10 14:14:44,"LOVE the game but the resin cap is too less. The cooldown for the refresh is just too long and the cost for hunting bosses is too high, if this issue is resolved this game will easily be 5 stars.",Positive,195,40
O H,2020-11-11 10:42:41,Great game! Game play is a lot of fun and the open world has much to explore. Controls are a bit difficult on mobile but as to be expected on mobile.,Positive,149,31
CLARK,2020-11-15 16:49:03,Game is really good. My only complaint is that the game is not optimized. Even with a tab s7 plus that has a snapdragon 865 + the game has frame drops after a couple of minutes of playing.,Positive,188,38
Dan31,2020-10-30 19:52:48,"Great game, but sometime it need long times to load the games. And it will be great if we can use controller to play because to running i need to move my thumb to centre left screen. Thank you",Positive,192,39
Brynna Mclaughlin,2020-11-01 11:57:13,"Overall really good game, I do notice some glitches where waypoints aren't where they're supposed to be, same with enemies for daily missions. Sometimes it will lag pretty bad during battles too",Positive,194,32
michael fernandez,2020-11-09 20:58:23,There's a bug on the character select. There is a star and confirm button on top of the 'requies adventure rank 35'. I can't go back to the main screen.,Positive,152,30

Daboel D,2020-11-14 15:04:38,"The game is very good , but since new update, this game isn't playable when fighting on my phone even with very low setting (I'm use phone with soc sd675, 8gb ram) hopefully next update will bring some improvement for mediocre device",Positive,233,42
Thyxs 123,2020-11-11 20:46:35,"I had problems when Amber is aiming, my game seems to be lagging and whenever I toggled Amber's aiming it barely moved, I've adjusted the sensitivity of the camera on aiming mode but nothing changed at all, please fix it",Positive,220,40
Kathrine I√±igo,2020-11-09 09:07:38,"The game is good but the background music is static. At first I thought it was my device that has problem but when I tried with my other game, its background music played smoothly unlike Genshin Impact with static music at the background.",Positive,238,43
geoffrey nelson,2020-11-08 11:03:01,"too early to give complete experience review. so far, it is really fun! nice graphics, open world, and generous up front. hopefully it stays that way",Positive,149,26
Collin Dustman,2020-11-01 09:13:48,Absolutely love this game. Graphics are nice and the combat is cool. Only downside is no controller support. Would love this feature to be added.,Positive,145,25
CasualByDefault,2020-11-11 08:48:35,"Only flaw that i can see on the regular is the fact that the game has to reload everytime you tab out to do something, including checking discord. Needless to say this is quite annoying.",Positive,186,35
Sheetal Ravani,2020-11-11 10:43:27,The game itself is phenomenal but the gacha system is way too exploitative. The only reason I'm not giving this game a 3 star because of it is because the game devs are reworking on the gacha system.,Positive,199,38
-PastelAbi-,2020-11-07 06:25:38,"This game, no doubt is really fun to play. I would rate it 5 stars if I just didn't keep crashing when I play. Hopefully you fix this problem.",Positive,142,29

rafflewaffle,2020-11-04 18:01:36,"Though i love this gane so much, i gotta day the phone version is the watered down version. If you could please use a computer to play this. And if you dont like mouse and keyboatd u can even connect a controller to it.",Positive,219,44
OGame Sun,2020-11-01 11:01:40,Its a good game but I have problems with keeping a smooth connection. It keeps disconnecting and reconnecting me every 10mins which affects my gameplay. I am playing on American server.,Positive,185,31
vrecyn,2020-10-31 12:05:42,"Four stars, because of the graphics and the beginning of the game, which is absolutely amazing. Content wise, you find yourself lacking it as you progress. Combat can be repetitive. Materials are restricted by currency like resin which is horrible. Resources take too long to gather, which makes sense, allows for more exploration. You find yourself lacking chests as time passes, leading to less things to do. I've space out quests between exploring but I still feel like there isn't enough to do.",Positive,498,83
Nitin Singh,2020-11-11 12:35:28,Everything things is awesome in this game but I installed it yesterday and it is of 6 gb internal game download and today an update came up. It is telling me to download 6 gb file again. I really don't want to download such a big file again and again,Positive,250,50
VAMPIRE GAMING YT,2020-11-14 08:48:25,"The only reason that I am giving 4 star is the auto select of server. As I live in India (Asia), but always when I open the game it always select American server. Please fix this issue ASAP !",Positive,191,39
Salve Billete,2020-11-12 22:31:02,This game is fun and amazing. But there's one problem. My adventure rank won't increase even when my adventure experience is like 6455/4560. Please fix this bug,Positive,160,27
No Name Here,2020-11-12 00:14:51,Loved it but it's not the best but for free Omg it's like a dream CAME TRUE hope you guys make more games like this an I hope too see the game progress. To the creators hope you guys have a fantastic year!,Positive,205,43
pritykana choudhury,2020-11-16 01:59:32,A nice openworld game with always something to do. The storyline is quite nice. But the lag and low frame rate even at minimal settings sometimes becomes a terrible problem.,Positive,173,30
andre assassin,2020-11-13 09:46:29,The game is one of the best mobile games ever the only problem is it needs a better multiplayer system players and I tell you that I would also need a PVP and Co-op system after it does that I'll give it five,Positive,208,43
Ahsany Taqwim,2020-11-14 05:38:04,"This game was ridiculous. The graphic, the sound, the visual effect it's great. I hope for next update they add controller support for mobile cause my hand was really sweaty.",Positive,174,30
Dracon,2020-10-31 09:51:37,So far so good Hardly play any other games since i downloaded it. Yall need to work on the smoothness of game for lower phones tho cause this phone can run it well but you could see its trying to keep up with some of the graphics.,Positive,230,47
sukhpreet Singh Heer,2020-11-02 08:10:20,The game is ver good and fun to play the store line is also very good but game have some little problem which make it difficult to injoy it some time it just disconnected with server and some time cut seen does not show but it really a good game,Positive,245,50
Kerstine Girasol,2020-11-11 11:24:10,"Hmmmm everytime I play, especially when I'm attacking monsters, it becomes laggy af even if my ram is still big. It becomes so laggy. My storage is still big(24 gb left) and so is my ram(4gb).",Positive,192,36
Cascale Edits,2020-11-10 17:05:10,"As a free open-world game, I'm totally in love with this game. The voice acting is superb, the graphics are amazing on PC and even great on mobile, and I really love the storyline in this game. I gave it four stars for two reasons. One, the original resin system is kinda weird. I have played games (e.g Arcaea) that waits 6 hours to refresh a certain item but, I can't be bothered to wait 16hrs on resin. That's a little too much. Two, after AR37~ there isn't really anything much to experience apart from daily commissions, bosses, and ley line crops. I'm sure this would be fixed with more storyline on a later update but, this makes it a little boring after AR37. Apart from that, it's a must play. The game is AWESOME.",Positive,723,135
Colton Weingarden,2020-11-11 09:16:36,"Great game. Only thing, is to stop the time pay wall. Make the heroes a bit less chancy. Seriously applaud the production value and quality of the game.",Positive,152,28

Tenma Unomiya,2020-11-13 10:31:47,The game is nice and graphics are just out of the world but main problem though being the game size being too big and not optimized properly for 3gbram phones and freeezes when enjoying the game spoils the experience.......hope fix it soon üò≠,Positive,241,43
Casey Vance,2020-11-15 21:48:58,"The game has a breath of the wild playstyle, but it tries to infuse story into every side quest. Making it difficult to differentiate the important details from the throwaway plots.",Positive,181,31
Jades del Rosario,2020-11-04 08:41:22,"An almost perfect game, but missing a few things in mobile support... Particularly native controller support. Would have been a five star with controller support.",Positive,162,25
Hydra 22,2020-11-07 04:57:55,"Amazing game, only issue is that I can't cross server play with friends in other servers with the characters I have and there is no server in South Africa so there is alot of lag.",Positive,179,35
iinrb,2020-11-05 16:02:19,"Need more optimization in Samsung A51, it has sound glitch only when they talk, and especially when fighting. This happened after I updated my phone OS. It was fine before",Positive,171,30
DiabolicGuy,2020-11-08 23:45:14,One of the best RPG game and it's for free the game has a gacha put system but it's not a main center of the game but it's dose require time to for side quests and items are sometimes hard to pickup.,Positive,199,42
Michelle Pineda,2020-11-10 22:03:33,"The resin limit needs to be improved. Other than that, the game is great. Just a few bugs when you TP to other place but it doesn't affect the game.",Positive,148,30

lXl lZl,2020-11-11 14:54:25,"This game is really good but can you please don't make us download the 6GB data in game after every update? It took a very long time to finish. Other than that,the game is very awesome",Positive,184,36
Kelvin Ng,2020-11-03 07:46:12,"The game is fun. Occasionally the game will bug and quest npc/commission mobs will be invisible. As a result, i cant hit the mobs/complete the quest until the next time i play",Positive,175,32
Nishant,2020-11-05 23:47:50,"Awesome scenes & epic open world game but phones get damn hot while playing in 60fps setting and there's issue like sound coming from device speaker if i connect my earphone after starting game and can't login in mobile data network, always shows error",Positive,252,44

Mother of Robots,2020-10-18 22:17:56,"Almost everything about this game is great! The way the world is own yet it's pretty clear where you need to go to progress, the cute character designs, plus really pretty graphics! Only issue is the discerned are all janky in some way, whether it be freezing on one frame, static-y audio or both, it's really just not pleasant. And it sucks because the story is interesting!",Positive,375,67
Danielle Adorno,2020-11-14 03:53:11,"The game is beautiful and probably the most solid MMORPG I played on a mobile device. For a free game it's done very well. This is definitely one of those games that gives you a good bit of content and new characters. I will say the developers did a good job of allowing you to get primo gems to do a do pulls here and there. However, with that being said the drop rates hurt my soul.",Positive,384,77
Xerian Plays,2020-11-03 18:57:38,Ok at first but then when you played it for a long time you'll notice that the game is limiting your character growth because of the resin and other stuffs.,Positive,156,30
Shiroe,2020-11-08 05:49:41,I like the game so far but my phone redmi 8 (4gb ram) barely runs it hopefully the Devs adds more graphics options like lowest shadow less effect etc thats all and please pay attention to this comment! Keep up the good work,Positive,223,43
Mika Melin,2020-11-02 03:57:57,"Brilliant exploration, beautiful graphics, amazing combat all clad in the traditional casino-style gacha game. The game is fairly good with giving you currency to spend on summons, but at the same time it always leaves you thinking, what if I spend a coin or two. That feeling of somewhere right around the corner, you'll hit the famous pay wall. For a free game there's a solid 20-30 h of great gameplay in one of the best mobile games I've ever played, without spending coins, so do what you will",Positive,498,89
Luwiz Tanamor,2020-11-15 23:55:35,The only thing I dont like about this game is the optimization. It favors Snapdragon midrange chipsets more than Helio Chipsets even though my SOC is more powerful than SD 720G I still get lower frames please game developers ca you optimize for Mediatek too.,Positive,258,45
Jonathan,2020-11-11 11:18:00,"I loved the as soon as it came out however, there are flaws. The resin system isn't the best, its very limiting. And there is a lack of things to do after about AR38",Positive,165,34
J J,2020-11-14 08:41:54,Great game. Just wish it had a few things like Auto Run and floating menus (instead of menus taking up whole screen). Hope there will be voice dubbing for more languages!,Positive,170,31
Zeping Lin,2020-11-11 13:04:14,"Visually a good game, not too much in p2w mechanics. Only negative is the lack of controller support on the mobile version as that would make gameplay a little more comfortable",Positive,176,31
SdewXGreat,2020-10-25 12:20:14,"The music in this game is very nice, played by famous band. The story line is nice too. Graphics is very good... Too good until it very consumes battery and causes overheating. Currently, I'm on the lowest graphics but the game still kills my battery. A gameplay for 30 mins can consume 10% of the phone's battery. Currently I'm using Oppo F9. I highly recommend the developer to enable an even low graphic option. This will help a lot of players tht play on mobile.",Positive,466,85
Tornado Dark,2020-11-07 17:52:25,"Been having issues with the game as the sound is fuzzy or the bit rate is a bit off , I am using a galaxy A71 the game is good in general but such small bugs can ruin the entire experience",Positive,188,41
Doggo Dudes,2020-10-24 10:00:59,"The game is great, yes, but with a few flaws. The game quite a while for me to load at the start of the game. I don't know of this happened to anyone else but it's a big problem for me. And the characters and scenery sometimes freeze mid-cutscene. Other than these reasons, the game is perfect! If the bugs were fixed, I would rate this five stars",Positive,347,68
Gary Marshall,2020-10-29 23:50:58,Great job. I think you can get 5 stars if you gave more for the amount of money you spend in game. I will admit I do like the direction this game is going.,Positive,155,34
AltGamer 1,2020-11-02 02:57:20,If I can play with the same character stats I have on my playstation and share both accounts gameplay into one I would give a 5 star but the game feel like a console game when I play on mobile good graphics and the rpg element really is good on here also,Positive,254,52
MrSkull 90,2020-11-07 22:54:53,"No event no more story, finish explore. Just do a same thing all day more like job. Nice graphics but its like empty now.need more content fast because people start to play other game now.",Positive,188,35
Ronnie Agustin,2020-11-01 18:03:55,"Overall the gameplay is fantastic, the fighting mechanics is so well polished and unique. Good storyline, good voice acting, soundtracks, etc. What I don't like about it is the resin system and the way on how you level up your characters. Currently I am AR42, I played for a month now, after reaching AR30 and when you've maxed all statues and collected all chests, there nothing much to do anymore, because if you need to progress you need resins, which is very slow to regenerate",Positive,481,85
Joe Starburn,2020-11-11 09:08:08,"The game itself is really good, but the fact that every update costs more than 5 GB of data is disappointing. If this continues, I don't think I'd be playing for much longer",Positive,173,33
luke jasone benitez,2020-11-12 02:13:29,"I could have been best if they put some kind of world chat and guild system coz in the long run, you'll get bored coz there's no one to talk to or ask some tips to ingame.",Positive,171,37
Joseph Williams,2020-11-11 06:13:55,"Love the game!! My only issue is the camera rotation, sometimes when I am in battle, I'm seeing mostly the ground/grass, not the enemy",Positive,134,24
Gem Delos Reyes,2020-11-11 10:01:43,"This game is pretty good, i like the graphics, characters etc. The only problem is it takes so long to download the resources of the game",Positive,137,26
Azrif,2020-11-13 12:05:19,"If the game can make the 'first time offer' purchase for the primogems be renewed, then it would be worth it for me to spend more money to the game.",Positive,148,30
anne verhallen,2020-11-11 13:32:49,"The game is of very high quality for a gacha, great gameplay. And the option to play it on pc makes things even better since those with potato-phones can still play too. There's some glaring issues like the design of the resin system, but it's a new game and devs need time to listen to feedback and find ways to implement changes that'll benefit both us and the company. I am looking forward to the future of this game. I'm primarily a pc player and I would like to see a PayPal pay option on there",Positive,499,96
Nayeeb Alam,2020-11-11 11:31:35,One of the best Open World Games in mobile i have ever played. Storyline is addictive and power ups are alos pretty cool. Wish they increased the speed of running in game.,Positive,171,32
Danielle Krause,2020-11-12 12:20:45,"Beautiful game, endless little things to find and gather. My only dislike is how difficult it is to get new characters.",Positive,119,21
Luis Enrique,2020-11-05 08:45:36,"I rarely review anything, but given the fact that this game has brought me so much joy i decided to do so. The game is well polished, and its beautiful. Buuuut, sadly it seems to have an incomplete story(update coming nov 10) and the current late game is slow, repetitive and sadly stale. The gacha system is very unfair sometimes and getting the characters you want might prove to be a challenge. However i recommend people to play it and see if its for them. /End",Positive,465,86
Dantzel,2020-11-01 23:10:29,"For this type of game it is really good, i always play a game that have a story, but the problem to this game is definitely the resin, it regenerates too long, maybe lower to 5 or 4 minutes, 8 minutes is too long. And another thing is that the chance of getting a 5 star character is really small, like u need to spend so much money, well maybe if ur lucky yes u can get 2-3 or more 5 star char, but please increase the chance to get 5 star character",Positive,450,93
prisim,2020-10-25 18:09:20,"This is a very polished game and is a breath of fresh air personally for me to have such a experience on a mobile device and I will say that the devs have made it exceptionally well in order for most phones to run it. Personally what makes me laugh is the fact that people are complaining of the lack of things to do when it's not even a finished game! These mfs act like the gacha and resin system is the main part of the game, sorry that we have lives and can't play it for 20 hours everyday",Positive,493,100
MrGold,2020-11-08 01:29:16,super boring and repititive end game content ... all other content is amazing. The game also lags a bit on mid tier mobiles . Should also add feature to show FPS in game while playing.,Positive,184,35
Xeru Tec,2020-10-25 19:19:27,"Mainly, i play this game on PC and i love the atmosphere. Also the ability to switch to mobile. The company isn't a 0815 one and they work with the community, very active and friendly. As u can see in their forums they asked the community how they should build this game and this is beautiful! The only bad thing is, the important update needs to be released and they wait 1 month for it.. it gets kinda boring.. also some issues with resins + the unfair gacha makes the game not so fun as i thought.",Positive,500,97
Reading Reid,2020-11-04 12:39:26,The game is pretty good but it gets very laggy after you play for a bit and recently its just been starting laggy and the audio is all choppy and its just hard to play at the moment.,Positive,182,38
Marvin Mclean-Anderson,2020-10-30 00:47:36,"The game is brilliant, it just needs more content and a better co-op experience... But it's still early days, there's still room for progress üëåüèø",Positive,144,25
sajin Chandran,2020-11-06 04:39:08,Great game easy to start in with simple controls has beautifully put together story and cutscenes though it's resin becomes a problem when you reach at 30+ just a little tweak in the resin system would do this game a great favour,Positive,229,42
Eleazar Josiah .T,2020-11-09 23:54:03,This game is absolutely fun. The problem lays in the much-hated resin system. The spike in difficulty between world levels are too great too.,Positive,141,24
Tung Nguyen,2020-11-08 23:26:33,"Good game, good graphic, good gameplay, but got many gamble on gameplay, you can try if you can control yourself, if you not stairway from this game.",Positive,149,27
jess uy,2020-11-13 20:09:37,"Good conditions and fun to play but after the 1.1 update, the aim shot for the bow has a problem in mobile, plss fix as soon as posible if you encounter this problem in aim shot!",Positive,178,36
AK Rohith,2020-11-11 19:13:52,The new update seems to have some few bugs. Im having frame drops when I play it in 60fps..It used to come in 60fps until this new update cameüòÄ. Hope you guys fix it soon! :),Positive,174,36
Blank YD,2020-10-18 06:27:07,"It is one of the best mobile games to date! But the issue is once you reach a threshold in the game where you finished the story mode, most side quests, collected all the Anemoculus and Geoculus, and etc. You can't really do much, but wait for your resins to refill and do daily commissions. I would like Resins to have a slight refresh time to be lower so that someone can gather more resins in one day and allow them to keep grinding.",Positive,436,84
E,2020-10-23 11:15:51,"This game is super fun and I enjoy it alot, but there's still a ton of room for improvement, like the resin system, this is one of the most important resources in the game and yet it recharges at a snails pace, I just wish that they can make it recharge faster. Even a 10-15% decrease on the timer would help a lot and would make a lot of people's lives easier.",Positive,361,72
Steven Theo,2020-11-11 13:42:18,"I'm having trouble download the resources file. It fails to download all the time, even when my internet connection seems just fine. Please help, i'm really looking forward to try this game",Positive,189,32
Estefan Laure,2020-10-30 13:33:35,"Smooth graphics, relaxing background music, and cool storyline. My kind of adventure game. My only problem is it heats up my phone really fast hehe",Positive,147,25
Sylvia Lovett,2020-10-20 18:25:29,"I've been playing the game for a few days and I'm really upset that the world doesn't fully load in this new phone. I'm stepping on either the water void or extremely brightly colored grass lands. It only fully loads in my computer and that bugs me a lot because I'd rather play this game in my phone. Other than that, it's addicting. It's kind of funny to see all the character models not having faces. I'm playing in the lowest graphics settings.",Positive,448,83
TheMadMan Escaped,2020-10-18 05:10:24,"This game is truly a fun experience overall. You get a few free gacha rolls here and there without feeling the need to spend money. There are a few problems with the game though. Some of these problems include the in game resin system and the performance. The resin system recharges 1 resin every 8 minutes. Dungeons cost 20 resin, mini bosses cost 40, and farming nodes cost 20. Resin runs out too fast. Performance: the gameplay gets really choppy /w low FPS in some areas.",Positive,475,86
Anne Wong,2020-10-25 15:19:34,"Love love this game so far! I'm trying to get Diluc but no luck yet. I kinda don't like that as your Adventure Rank goes up, the monsters get tougher too...would be nice to have areas to farm that don't have such strong monsters. Also, please have more daily, monthly and/or event promos on gem top-ups (yes I buy sometimes), or even subscription deals.",Positive,353,64
Samuel Ky,2020-10-19 08:49:07,"It's amazing that the game can perform so well on mobile. I'm hoping that this version of the game gets gamepad support since it works on pc/ps. The setting is pretty, interactions between your playable characters are voice acted, exploration is a fun escape. The combat plays like an action game, with a gimmick for switching between 4 characters to combo elemental abilities. Save enough to do 90 consecutive summons for a guaranteed 5* character. Gacha is abysmal with a 0.6% rate for 5*.",Positive,491,84
Abel Catalincescu,2020-11-01 01:02:39,"I have been waiting for about an year and it's finally here.... When i saw it i was actually crying tears of joy. After all, this is a AAA pc game on mobile, and it's f2p. Edit: turns out it's not all rainbows and unicorns, at some point the stamina system of the game will simply stop you from playing more than half an hour a day... Please save this beautiful game from certain doom!!!",Positive,387,75
Sean Callahan,2020-10-20 20:50:15,"The game is wonderful, if you liked Breath of the Wild or skyrim, theres a good chance you'll enjoy this game. There are timed mechanics like most other mobile games, and it does have a hero collection system based on using in game gems to get 'rolls' for heros and weapons. This does not detract from the game, as the real emphasis is picking your desired playstyle, whether it be maining 1 hero or having a rounded team. My ONLY warning is take your time. Enjoy the game. Don't try rushing it.",Positive,495,92
Kendrick Tan,2020-11-15 19:06:44,"Updated for 1.1: Story can get confusing but I'm here for the stellar gameplay. At AR45 right now, and grinding for artifacts is hilariously frustrating because of terrible rolls for stats and substats.",Positive,202,33
Steven Bartolome,2020-10-25 21:39:32,"I really enjoyed playing this game but there are some problems that are affecting the players experience of enjoying the game, one of those is the resin system, the resin system is stopping the ability of a player to go to a roadblock everyday as a very grindy player, but don't get me wrong I love the game but just hoping the devs can improve the resin system substantially, not just by increasing the resin limit but also decreasing the time per resin.",Positive,455,83
harish nair,2020-11-11 13:31:42,The game needs a lot of optimisations for it to be a good mobile game. In the current form it's more of a PC or console oriented game.,Positive,134,28
Galaxy lover,2020-10-27 21:18:44,"Amazing game, really. One day I was just wanting to play the game and I was logged out. I tried to log back in but I couldn't. I remember my password yet it still won't let me log in. 4/5 stars, because if that didn't happen i still would've had it rated a five star. Now I have to restart after almost finishing the game.",Positive,322,65
Bumble Bee,2020-10-31 08:57:49,"Really good game but a problem is that the ground isn't shaded or textured, its just a pure black with grass and objects sticking out. If you can fix it that be great, I have a LG Velvet if that info helps",Positive,205,42
Erick Garcia,2020-10-19 01:12:52,"Overall: Great game! The Graphics are beautiful, the characters are pretty cool, the world is just masterfully built. HOWEVER, I have my complaints. To start off, the Resin system is atrocious, workable, but atrocious, its constantly just trying to stay afloat and running out VERY quickly The gameplay gets extremely repetitive AR20+, however that's understandable as only two of the 7/8 regions have been released, so the other content is gonna take a bit. Seriously tho, the Resin system is bad",Positive,497,81
Vincent Poh,2020-11-04 00:55:58,Its have been great untill my luxurious chest inside the shrine was not been able to open even I relog game still dont let me open the chest and I have been asking them to fix this but no replied since then quite disappointing with the service to be honest,Positive,256,50
Li Kyun,2020-11-07 09:33:55,Everything seems fun to play a lot of things to do. Easily distracted. I think it be great to have some extra stuff for co op too.,Positive,130,27
KHALED GXD,2020-11-03 17:29:43,I really like the graphics and the texture of the game but I would like to control the character with a phone controller if this is already a feature then I don't think it works on Huawei phones,Positive,194,38
Lester Hype,2020-11-11 05:21:31,I like if a lot new concept of RPG games much better than others RPG we need more like this huge history art is the best of the games out there massive content and the best is the event deserve the spending of money has honestly good deals,Positive,239,48
LamoKS,2020-11-11 06:49:08,The game is great and have a cool story line but i hope you can make the game more optimize and less lag. Also i like the new update.,Positive,133,29
Bobby 811,2020-11-11 09:39:28,"I like the game and all but when updatin it takes a long time and alot of MB, well at least I can exit out the game and wait for it to download.",Positive,144,33
Kenneth's Journey,2020-11-11 07:35:55,"Truly amazing game and the graphics are so prettyyyyyyy. only reason i give it 4‚òÜ instead of 5‚òÜ is bcuz it gets really laggy sometimes and it drains my battery really quickly, otherwise great game (:",Positive,199,36
Gamingwith Populardan,2020-11-11 00:48:50,Its super fun but my story line glitched and i keep repeating the same thing it just loads and sends me back and when i try to report the problem theres no story line glitch as a report only domains characters and etc which kinda sucks,Positive,235,46

Pruthviraj Kiggal,2020-11-12 22:39:09,"Great game, drop rate for 4 star character and weapons are very low. Souvenir shop does not restock items and if domain is yet to unlocked.. there is no way to get materials for ascending",Positive,187,35
Jada Pea,2020-11-14 21:48:37,A very good story line and lots of adventure and fantasy lays here. The only problem is when a animated high quality cut scene is up on phone it gets VERY VERY glitchy.,Positive,168,33
joseph becker,2020-11-11 11:37:41,"Great work Mihoyo! Phone burns brighter than the sun for how hot it gets, and there could be full controller support, but overall really great game.",Positive,148,26
Nonmoi Andone,2020-10-22 07:15:34,"Great game, with some improvments left to be desired. Please add native controller support/key mapping to the mobile version. Adding auto item pick up (even if only for drop items) would help a lot too. The game is improving in the right direction, and it will hopefully easier for casuals to finish dailies in less time, while offer enough for devoted to do before 1.5 hit somewhere middle of next year.",Positive,404,71
Seras Rain,2020-10-31 01:44:36,"amazing game, hope that the 50 summons for a 5 star selection is true, I would only start buying crystals then. gem gain is too slow, needs 3 months to reach pity",Positive,162,32
A MS,2020-10-27 17:34:34,"This is a fun and beautiful game but I just can't get a 5 stars. I need 30 more for a pity but now there's no more quest so I can't get many primogems anymore. Hearing many people says they got many five stars just makes it more worst. To be honest I'm devastated. I've spend a lot of time on this game trying to get primogems but it just didn't worth it. I never got any 5 stars, if I can just get a 5 star character before 90 pulls I would definitely rate this to 5 stars",Positive,473,99
Yohan Yuwono Ardiyanto,2020-10-27 09:18:07,"4 stars for the game, very nice game why not 5 stars then? because the camera kinda sucks. It keeps zooming in (trying to get to the default position?) No dammit, I want my camera to stay as I intended. I wished there is a patch the let player freely adjust their camera position (not always reverting back to it's original position), it especially annoying when camera is getting inside bushes or grasses when fighting in a narrow places",Positive,438,79
Tohkie,2020-10-27 10:34:43,"Very Beautiful Game, but my problems with it is when the cutscenes don't play, usually stuck on a certain part of the cutscene or black screen, but the captions still play, Lag and Connecting in, even when my Wi-Fi is good. I Hope these get fixed pleaseee üôè I really do want to enjoy the game, but I can't fully enjoy the game if these aren't fixed.",Positive,349,67
Grandpapa Chai,2020-10-21 07:39:20,"Game is pretty good. Great graphics and different languages to listen to other than English. An issue see is summoning characters, which very few times I ever summon a character, which is frustrating to say the least. Another is acquiring the fate materials for summoning. I cannot say this has good rates for gacha summoning. Finally, getting only weapons when summoning for characters is also annoying.",Positive,404,66
Amor Pascua,2020-10-28 20:58:35,"After i update it, there's a cracking sound on my audio. So fix it pleaseeeee. But its a good game. But because of the cracking sound its a 4 star",Positive,146,30
Waysure,2020-11-04 12:25:57,Graphic bug. Textures are gone and some are clipping through. And when im close to ending a quest with the graphic bug still there my character teleports from the last frame until it's unplayable,Positive,195,34
basel mohammed,2020-10-31 18:12:39,It's an awesome game. Though my only concerns are that it's a wifi needing game not an offline one. 2nd everytime I close the app for something quick it restarts the loading scene,Positive,179,33
zahir safuan,2020-11-01 02:45:45,"At first this game was interesting until i reached ar32. And make one dungeon for primogems, it makes me wanna stop playing when the primogems is getting harder to get and no more quest to do.",Positive,192,36
oof yikes,2020-11-02 10:11:11,"Excellent game, very fun, interesting story, cool characters... but you put dogs and cats in the game and won't let us pet them so only 4 stars",Positive,143,27
Ricky Ruiz,2020-11-11 10:16:33,"Amazing quality, probably the best mobile game. Still has a long way to go but easily a 5 star game when it's complete",Positive,118,23
Christopher M Brown,2020-11-11 09:27:21,Overall it's a very good game though the summoning system is really confusing the graphics are beautifully designed I'd be sure to try this game out on the ps5 here soon.,Positive,170,31
Sundry Odin,2020-10-23 09:27:27,"This is an amazing game , great graphics and everything , but i have to give it a four star because the resin system needs to be changed .(for those who dont know ,resin is energy to enter special dungeons and get rewards after special bosses). Your max resin is 120 and 1 resin recovers every 8 minuites , so to get 120 resin back you need to wait around 10-16 HOURS , and each dungeon costs 20-40 resin each so you are limited on how much you can do per day . Other than than its a great game",Positive,494,100
Manime amvs,2020-10-20 21:39:29,"The graphics, story, character development, voicing is great. I am really enjoying while playing this. It's addictive.

Aditya Dhir,2020-11-13 20:29:50,"Summon chances could be better. Performance can be improved, sometimes there are fps drops even though my phone has a Snapdragon 865 which is the most powerful processor as of yet. Ping remains high despite a super fast internet sometimes, maybe more servers would help.

Jonathan Thompson,2020-10-22 02:33:56,"The visual style and exploration is appealing to me, even though this is a Gacha with low rates, this doesn't seem very pay to win, its honestly the closest to having a free to play console experience. Only issues at this time are lack of controller on mobile, issues using PC version, and I'm waiting on Switch version that has Mihoyo accounts so we can cross save! Then I can play game more often!",Positive,399,74
Anni,2020-10-21 10:23:04,"A stunning and breathtaking game with versatile combat, incredible physics, and open world exploration similar to Breath of the Wild. I love the story, and am holding my breath for the next release. Notes: - This game drains my battery hardcore; my phone's % battery still goes down even when I'm on the charger. - Please let me pet the dogs and cats. The dog by the Mondstadt General Goods store is begging for belly rubs. - Bow combat is a little wonky if you're not in ""aiming mode""",Positive,485,89
Dipak Bastola,2020-11-14 14:41:24,Story is great and open world is vast and immersive. There are minor issues like frame rate drop during fight in open world and all but overall great game.,Positive,155,29
Zach Taylor,2020-10-20 00:39:20,"This game is great. I would give it 5 stars except for 2 reasons I'd love the developers to implement. I wish there was controller support for phones. And I wish the pc version allowed controller support natively, without me having to turn it on each time I turn the game on. If they add these this would easily be a 5 star game for me.",Positive,336,66
Alan Paradox,2020-10-24 21:50:09,Very vast open world which i really love! There is also lots of strong and unique characters to collect. Awesome story and game mechanics.

An awesome game nevertheless. 10/10 would recommend.,Positive,351,63
Vytautas Makulaviƒçius,2020-10-27 22:10:30,"Its one of the best games i have played. Breathtaking open world, music, stoy, constant progress, gliding, co-op with other players :))) On the other side i wish there would be one load screen instead of three loads untill youre rdy to play.

Ëâ≤Refanita,2020-10-21 00:10:46,"Aside from the lag on the cutscene but this is on mobile after all so its pretty understandable, but i pretty much love it. the game controls is very easy to remember, fighting the monsters is very fun, the game is very challenging yet really possible to beat which is very on my preference, the lore is kinda cliche but the feeling of it really touches my heart. they're so many quest that i can lvl up which is very helpful to me because grinding is kinda a bit hard. all in all its lots of fun!",Positive,497,97
Shingetsu Nokami,2020-10-26 13:24:46,"Great game, however the resin is limited to do anything meaningful when you reach end game, and the gatcha rates on 5 star characters is crazy horrible with how little premium currency you earn, even the pity roll won't guarantee a character (its weapon or character). The currency packs are super expensive as well. It is amazing at what it does but they need to fix some of these things and make it more FTP or do a monthly sub or they will start loosing a lot of people.",Positive,473,89
Kolette M,2020-11-08 03:51:45,Really excellent game. Needs some improvements like poor exp gain late game but a solid foundation Just don't get sucked in to the predatory gacha and watch your wallet.,Positive,169,29
Magical Miranda,2020-11-02 10:12:08,This is a very fun game! Although there is a quest I can't get through to let me get in other servers.. can you please fix this?,Positive,128,27
any idea,2020-11-02 10:37:27,It is a very good open world game some times before continuing the story you need to level up with some times takes a lot of time great story line and characters,Positive,161,32

Neal Maddy,2020-11-05 07:49:01,So far i really enjoy this game. No auto feature and seems to be a genuine mmorpg. Good music etc... Id give it 5 stars if there were more resources to be had,Positive,158,33

Slimey,2020-11-09 04:10:28,"So yeah, this game is probably the best dog game I found. However the fact that it needs to use data to run makes it unplayable. Once I finished the first cutsene everything falls apart. Paimon's face is missing and her pupils are the only ones who aren't missing. The main character is jittery and the dragon... I don't even know why it takes up half of my screen. So what I'm saying is, it's a bad idea to use wifi/data to play the game. Since most of us have very poor internet.",Positive,481,93

Pixel,2020-11-11 14:09:53,"Very fin, and very great! Some mechanics are in need of a change, but I believe we will get the changes in due time.",Positive,116,24
Fluffles,2020-11-14 00:36:16,"Need more optimization, 60fps isn't an option if nothing changed from turning it on, can't run it on high setting or medium settings to play decently with an 27-30fps MAX.",Positive,171,30
Chikato The Panda,2020-11-14 02:28:32,The Rendering on Mobile has been kinda worst since the update some things look like Plastic even if i set my settings to max it still looks the same i wish this can be fixed soon it's kinda distracting.,Positive,202,39
koh yuhong,2020-11-11 09:00:38,"It has good story line, mechanics, graphics. The only downside is the auto rotating camera that can mess up the view during combat",Positive,130,23
Andrei Lomboy,2020-11-11 08:25:30,"Even though my signal was between 90ms-130ms the lag doesn't come off, Im always spending too much time waiting for it to run smoothly but its not happening please fix the network connection",Positive,190,33
Uel Tecson,2020-10-19 19:51:13,"This game is amazing! Graphics are beautiful! Gameplay is fun and addicting as heck! I would definietly rate this a 5/5... But the reason why I gave it a 4/5 is because of one annoying thing. And that thing is needing internet connection to play the game. I mean, C'mon! It's a single player open world exploration game! Why is internet connection necessary!? If I can play this offline. Then I'll give this a 5/5 star rating.",Positive,426,77
DqddyMolt,2020-10-24 23:29:41,"Amazing graphics, storyline, dialogue, effects, and soo much more that it makes it compatiable with any device no matter its low-end or not. ONLY PROBLEM is that We cannot add friends whether in different regions. Plus we would have to start all over again when connecting to a certain region just to play with certain friends across tge world.",Positive,344,59
Aryanda Galang Pradana,2020-10-27 20:29:49,The only down side from this game is the comunity who made tier list and speed run and made this game looks empty. I played it with my phase. Slow while appreciated it. Build characters I love and want to play while don't seeing the tier list. I still see the build though. What can I say is. Play at your pace and screw those people who play fast so they can looks cool and feel empty at the end. Btw i hate play it on touch screen. I need this to realased at nintendo switch too... Pretty please,Positive,497,99
Annita Eleanor,2020-10-23 03:03:18,"The graphics show how far mobile gaming has come - they compare to that of a console, without overheating the device or much lag!! The interface is quite manageable, albeit it can be hard to remember what is where. Also, there are so many mechanics it can be confusing & overwhelming on what you might want to focus on at first. My main issue is that it takes a LOOONG time to unlock many vital features. But despite all this, the game is certainly worth trying!!! I enjoy this refreshing game.",Positive,494,91
Sam Z„ÄÇ,2020-10-29 19:36:55,The game itself is great but the gacha drop rate is stupidly low overall this game has good mechanics and rich story but it's better play this on PC because you need a new generation phone to play this without lagging,Positive,217,41
Zee Zee Zhou,2020-10-28 15:16:22,"The devs are extremely ungenerous with the stamina system and the main currency for the gacha system. Further, you hit a content wall after 30 hours of playing, where you had so much fun playing the game but now there is nothing to do. I recommend uninstalling the game, or quitting and waiting for the next content update at this point.",Positive,337,61
Sniper Shot,2020-10-23 23:13:40,Very nice graphics and storyline. Controls and gameplay are great too. Wide variety of choices for characters and equipments. The only flaw is that guild level system is to high. It took more then 3 days to reach level 10 but in other rpgs I could be at 25 at day 3. But overall still a decent game and I highly recommend it.,Positive,325,63
Shido Shinigami,2020-10-22 22:10:17,The gameplay and the environment are really breathtaking and i really love Genshin Impact. I only gave 4 stars because of two things that annoy me most. The first thing is the drop rate of 5 stars characters. I used every gem i obtained in gachas and i never got a single 5 stars. The most annoying thing is collecting anemoculus and groculus. You can't even know what you have got and haven't so that i've to check it one by one again. It's worse than colleting trophies in Batman Arkham Knight,Positive,495,92
Dexter,2020-11-01 14:54:26,I wish there was an option where you can turn off the auto camera angle it just disturbs the fight and sometimes I can only see the ground.,Positive,139,28

Bagus Ardianto,2020-11-08 11:30:12,"i rarely put a good review for the apps or games, for me this game is quite good but terrible in control. if only there is gamepad support natively, 5* is waiting lol.",Positive,167,33
„Ç≥„ÉàÂá™,2020-11-07 12:49:30,"It's a good game. Good story, but I hope the puzzles get more variety soon other than a few repetitive dungeon designs and the *timed slime battles*.",Positive,149,27
Theodore Williams,2020-11-06 07:07:22,"This game is awesome... love the open world concept but in terms of character interaction, I have a thought one the matter. This my first RPG with the ""switch-character"" anywhere mechanics and I respect that a lot you know... being one of the things that make up Genshin Impact... buh if the Developers would consider restricting the character switching when in a cities so that... an individual's main ...doesn't bump into its NPC... thank youüòÅ",Positive,445,75
hihihi hahaha,2020-11-09 22:35:19,"these game is really good, everything is nicely made but it requires a very high-end phone to be able to play smoothly..",Positive,120,22
Kuroshinzo Ankakeru,2020-11-12 13:20:31,After the update on november 11 I experienced frequent FPS drops even at the lowest graphics possible. This has never happened before I will rate it 5* if it is fixed,Positive,166,31
cookie kar soon,2020-10-20 20:55:42,"A fun game indeed, even though is a gacha game but is definitely a f2p since you don't have pvp and fight for the top with other players, good graphics, nice story, why i give 4 stars is that, i really wanna get klee, but i have to spend so much time and resources on her, which makes me now reconsider of getting her, what i recommend is that GI could put a system where you can reset characters and weapons in a trade of maybe 100 primogems, if that happens i'll definitely give 5 stars",Positive,488,96
Edrian Cristobal,2020-11-11 16:02:08,The best open world rpg but I have an issue regarding the patch updates. Why do I still have to download additional audio assets when I only use the japanese dub. I mean 2gb of excess audio files that I don't use is a bad thing especially if it will be a thing in the next updates. I suggest that there will be an option for us to install specific audio files (exclude some if possible) to lessen download data.,Positive,411,80
Zi yu,2020-10-19 14:15:46,I dont play on moble but on consle I can say that it is a very good game. Its graphics r good for a 3d rpg and still has a long way to go. But there r some graphic issues and glitchs that r a problem but I dont really mind it that much. If ur looking for a rpg that on consle and cross platform this is the game. Also there is a gacha system in it and its ok but it needs some fixing and some other things too. Thank you MiHoYo for making this game and keep up the good work!,Positive,475,104
Hieronimus Narotama,2020-10-19 19:35:54,"good, fun and interactive combat, my experience on the game so far (AR39) is positive although i still dont like how long resin takes to fill, how you only get daily login from events or buy the welkin moon pack, low gacha rates, and chest grinding. these makes me concerned about the future of the game. hopefully they would improve the game.",Positive,343,62
Matt Coe,2020-10-28 09:46:34,"It's an incredible game for free, alot like breath of the wild. And it is a gatcha game but it won't affect the story or gameplay. It is a pay to win sorta of deal, the characters in the store are super powerful which would help with combat. All in all, a solid game with a really lame way to get more overpriced characters.",Positive,324,64
ZeroLog Dude,2020-11-12 15:47:32,I have some issue with the system where I cannot change my party setup if they are died which mean I cannot revive the character until I put the character into a squad which I cannot because the system does not let me use a died character into the party,Positive,253,50
Pallus,2020-11-04 13:05:11,Overall fun game and would recommend. Just watch out for the rates and have fun. Spend wisely on this game.,Positive,107,20
Tr∆∞·ªùng Nguy·ªÖn,2020-10-22 01:34:14,"The game is super clunky to control on a phone, so much that it feels like a different game while I play on PC. The combat is simple but exciting, though it depends on your characters. Being a gacha game means it'll be more fun to play when you have rarer characters. But that also means your first experience with the game may be absolutely garbage if you get bad pulls early. However, it still can be considered as an open world game which it excels at for its rich and beautiful world.",Positive,488,93
derpynani,2020-10-27 15:16:20,"i am addicted to this game! the graphics are good and so well as the story and quests! i would suggest to have a trading system of characters if we want to trade with our friends. I would also suggest to make Spiral Abyss a multiplayer game. Thats what i want to say, hope the version 1.1 will be awesome :D",Positive,307,61
shahid raza,2020-10-20 22:52:10,"Good storyline so far, great graphics. There seems to be optimisation problem with the game. I have one plus 7(SD855), when i crank the game to highest settings 60fps it does heats up drastically. Same device have been killing many other games at full settings such as Battle Prime that is known for its eye candy graphics and face no such heating issue at all and PUBG at HDR and Extreme frame rate(60fps) gives no issues either. Please optimise this game for 5stars. No other issues.",Positive,485,86
Oriel Reovoca Obuyes,2020-10-20 09:23:30,"Um, is it just me or there are times that the game crashes on some devices? I installed this game yesterday and finished downloading it, but when I started playing, the game crashes in the middle of the game. Is there anything I should do to address it? I really wanted to uninstall it now but I felt like I couldn't, not because I spend much data for it but because Paemon's just too cute. Overall, it's a great game, yet I'm looking forward for this crash issue to be addressed soon.",Positive,485,92
Brandon Mauricio Salas Ch√°vez,2020-11-11 09:31:17,"The game is good but today I couldn't log in with my Google account, it's there a problem?, I've already made purchases in the game in that account, I wouldn't like to lose...",Positive,175,33
James West,2020-10-19 09:27:37,"A great single player game, beautiful graphics and engaging gameplay. A really great free experience. I am loathe to spend money or recommend investing money in the game due to the late game content being very lacking atm along with the resin system being incredibly restrictive to gameplay hopefully multiplayer will also get tweaked to make it rewarding. Hopefully the devs will take comments on board and improve the late game/multiplayer/resin and keep this amazing game alive, time will tell!",Positive,497,80
Kimusa Hendrubar,2020-10-28 09:15:01,Out of 10 I'de give it an 8. The game over all is pretty easy to understand but my only issue is with camera but that's just a personal problem of mine but the biggest problem of this game is the gacha system. There's nothing wrong with having a gacha system but the rates just suck. If the gacha system gets an improvement It will be a 10.,Positive,340,68

Destiny,2020-10-28 20:45:08,"I really like this game, but the automated zooming everytime I climb or attack something is almost unbearable... I cant see anything and sometimes the camera is in the ground behind grass, or super zoomed into my charactee to the point I cant see anything. Or it may zoom in righr after I try to zoom out. Really wish you could zoom the camera out and it'll just be locked into that level of zoomed out.",Positive,403,76

Yepi Jephte,2020-11-01 14:22:49,"The game is really great but laggy for low end device, i know i can't blame you for the lag on the low end devices, but it would be really great if you make lowest settings smother :)",Positive,183,38

Aayush Bhoite,2020-11-11 11:19:52,"Absolutely loved the graphics, mechanism of the game, unique RPG but co-opable and several other bosses and quests. I'm in the ened game stage now and I don't really think I can do much to level up besides the daily commisions and the little resin I get by having it refresh for a while. Resin refresh takes too much time and I find this as a very progress hindering process. Lots of people are frustrated and wish to hope for a better change sooner in regards to resin refresh time.",Positive,483,90

hnap,2020-10-18 09:19:41,"I love the game play and graphics are the best! It does take up about half your gpu and is about 7gb of storage, but I think it's worth it.

mik,2020-10-18 18:02:35,"The gameplay is great and fun But it takes up alot of space and overheats my device frequently But still, the graphics are amazing and there is alot of voice acting. The game also gives the player alot of freedom to roam the world and discover different monsters and items. I believe the most challenging thing to defeat was the rune guardian as I had to hide behind the rocks and shoot it's weak spots using amber and also avoid it's rockets and attacks Overall this is an amazing game",Positive,486,90
Christopher Swift,2020-11-08 00:51:10,"I like the game a lot mostly because it's not like the other ""open world"" wannabe type games. This one really is open world!",Positive,124,24
Elizabeth Carr,2020-10-22 02:49:48,"Really love the game, absolutely fantastic on all fronts but one. My single complaint is about how much battery usage this app uses on my phone. 2 hours of play and my battery is dead this happens with no other game I have, so I checked in my phone settings to see how much battery this app is using. This game uses 87% of my Galaxy S9's battery where as my 2nd highest battery usage app is only 11% of my battery.",Positive,414,82

RaikiriÈõ∑Âàá,2020-10-18 03:21:53,"game itself is pretty impressive and graphics despite being mobile game is overwhelming, however it's ment to be played with a controller to get most experience out of it, so not having controller configuration on android is kinda sad, it is just my opinion, but if developers add controller configuration into the game it would definitely enhanse overall gameplay experience",Positive,375,60
Juan Diaz,2020-10-21 10:58:54,"The game is fantastic! But DAMN do you need to ease up on the monetization. Sure, you don't HAVE to spend money. But the abyss requires 8 leveled up characters and they have to be of specific elements. So you HAVE to wish to get more than 4 characters and primogems aren't as easy to come by as it feels. Either lower the cost of wishes or drastically improve drop rates. You guys are reaching new audiences and this is all going to kill your game. Which I would hate to see because I love the game.",Positive,499,97
Jacen Yiannackopoulos,2020-10-28 03:55:05,"This game will be talked about years from now as groundbreaking in terms of high quality mobile games.

There are still a few kinks to be worked out, but surely those will be addressed in the coming months, as this is still a very new release.",Positive,322,60
Selena Cardenas,2020-10-26 02:01:47,"I like almost everything although it tends to freeze & lag a lot but besides that it's quite enjoyable, the pulls are intriguing I just hope more characters stay within the Gacha part or the events stay a bit longer (ex: venti, I barely had enough for √ó10 and i spent a lot of time grinding) Oh also the exp for character levels are challenging to get if you have a handful of characters so use them wisely!!

Bleed Blue,2020-10-24 18:11:23,"Overall concept of this game is very simple and complex at the same time. Graphics are stunning. So many things to explore through adventure. Boss fights are extremely difficult. Still, I think developers can create little bit of balance in hero characters. It will be extremely hard for anyone to defeat world level bosses without at least one five-star character. I am facing same difficulty as I don't have one yet.",Positive,418,71
Natalia Ziembik,2020-10-24 22:16:59,"Love the game. It has beautiful scenery, game design and a wide variety of characters.

Lozz lozz,2020-11-12 07:35:05,Im having problems with sound on my galaxy s20. Its not working at all. Other than that I love this game.,Positive,105,21
Joemar Billones,2020-11-13 19:10:26,"Great and addictive game yet too much lag in asian server, please fix this issues, it is so hard to play and feel like the game is messing up with me!",Positive,150,31
John Carlo Berdos,2020-10-18 21:59:01,"For a free to play game this is great! The gameplay is amazing, graphics has excellent flexibility for types of devices even for a mid-range device it plays well albeit a couple of tweaks are needed. Controls are decent, really hope they add controller support for this one. Till then, it'll be 4/5 stars for me.",Positive,312,56
Jose Maria Deang,2020-10-18 06:35:51,"Breathtaking visuals as well as unique, but easy to learn combat. The world is pretty vast and there's a lot of things you can do (though pacing yourself would be optimal). Co-op is quite limiting, but enjoyable for what it is currently. Gacha rates are not actually so good and premium currency may be a little harder to come by at the latter parts of the current game, but other than that it's pretty solid.",Positive,409,75
Luis Rodriguez,2020-10-26 15:54:29,"I absolutely love playing this game. Its fun to explore the world, solve puzzles in the field, and follow the story. Waiting to get enough resin to get adventure points to rank up to continue the story bothers me a bit, but finding a random quest or chest makes and keeps exploration tempting. I wish you could get all the characters through quests at least once so I could play everyone instead of opening loot boxes and praying. Even so, I can't wait to see what else this game world has to offer.",Positive,499,93
Virgilio Paglinawan,2020-10-24 13:34:18,"As an action-adventure game, it is really good. Exceptional, in fact, compared to other mobile games in the market. My only gripe is the way Mihoyo motivates players to spend money. Just focus on cosmetics (I'm sure many will pay for those) and don't suddenly slow progression with the obviously flawed resin system.",Positive,316,53
Its Yo Boy,2020-10-18 12:33:35,"I don't know if it's just me or what but the wish purchase history isn't updating from your latest wish purchase. Please fix this, i dont know if it will affect my chances of better draws but when i checked the history of my purchase it was stuck from october 16 still even if i had already draw 3 more items these past 3 days. 4 stars because its a really really good game. Just need to fix a few bugs from here and there particularly the one im experiencing right now but really great overall!!",Positive,496,96
Erik C,2020-10-23 21:29:20,"Only played a little so far, but I love it! It's beautiful and very smooth to play. I don't often play mobile games, but this one caught my attention immediately! I'm holding out on the idea of controller support, I really hope that comes along. Will improve the experience a ton since my fingers won't be in the way of the gorgeous scenery.",Positive,341,63
"B09 Gianan, Karl Benedict A.",2020-10-28 12:38:37,"It is an awesome game, as it offers a open world mechanics and let you feel like travelling your own. But there is some drawbacks as you can only play for a little time, and the numbers of primogems you get is very limited so you are unlikely to roll even if you play on regular basis.",Positive,285,57
Alvin Auxtero,2020-10-21 15:46:56,"Camera control will be out of sight when in battle,take more seconds in picking items, too much loading everytime you teleport in other area.I've been waiting some land specialty to restore but it didn't like the Wolfhook in Wolvendom,it has said to be 24 hrs. but it's been 3 days right now.I don't have network problem maybe it just your server.Just fix it to become more interesting.",Positive,386,67
Dekota,2020-10-18 18:24:12,"Very beautiful game and gameplay, 4 stars due to lack of endgame (mostly just grind right now, but endgame is still a work in progress and they are planning updates and a new zone), but the first 25-30 hours is definitely 5 stars - gacha is there but it isn't required, a decent amount of free pulls are provided throughout gameplay",Positive,332,61
Kent JJ Perez,2020-10-28 05:04:11,"The gameplay are amazing, and the game is really unique than the other rpg. The only thing that it is a 4star for me is it has so many flaws. Like on the gacha system, i really like gacha games, but the gacha on the game was a little bit worse where 2 important things in the game was on the same banner.. i really hope on the future updates the weapon and heroes gacha are seperate. But on the good side i really enjoy the game and i hope to keep more nice updates in the future",Positive,479,98
Agni Saha,2020-10-25 14:50:24,"Pretty good till now. The controls are kinda good and the graphics is awesome. The biggest thing that I've noticed till now is that it isn't a pay-to-win game, your in-game knowledge and controls define your skill, and that's pretty rare and cool. But it gets a lot predictable, although I'm still a low leveled one and have a lot to unlock. Hope it has enough materials to hook me long enough.",Positive,394,72
andy 666,2020-10-24 23:27:49,"The game is really good! I'm fine with everything right now. But the only reason I give a 4 star is that the weapon summoning is a bit tedious. Its also a bit laggy, I've played other games of yours and happy to support you and hope you can make this game as smooth as your others!",Positive,281,57
Alyssa S. Putri,2020-11-11 09:51:51,"Great game , but the first Stormterror cutscene freezes in my Android phone. I have reinstalled and it still happened. Please fix?",Positive,130,22

Also cannot playing my new Galaxy TabA... would really like the bigger screen ... I'll use the phone for now though cause the story and graphics are fantastic. If they fix the axis issue and the tablet thing, I'll give it 5 stars.",Positive,327,61

Mikhail Haliq,2020-11-03 17:37:32,overall the game is pretty good and i have enjoyed the game for along time now but im having audio issues where the games audio keep on glitchin. devs can u fix this ?,Positive,167,34
Rosa S A,2020-11-07 16:46:44,"hello, i've been doing the tianqiu valley for so long and somehow cannot get past them, can you please remove the non co-op mode? i wanna play with my friends but i can't because the quest isn't finished, yet i have difficulties to complete them... please.",Positive,256,46

Ais H.,2020-11-11 05:55:05,The graphics are really good and I like the storyline. The only downsides are that it drains my battery and glitches,Positive,116,21
Ishant Kochar,2020-11-12 15:35:31,All was good but in the next update this game has become a rage game to me whenever I use my Pyro user it burns the grass which gives me a continuous damage of 190 also the monsters are very powerful,Positive,199,41
Raymond Omar,2020-11-15 18:11:25,The game is open world with plenty of content the elemental chain reations are a great and the characters you pull are relevent to the story the gacha rates could be better though.,Positive,180,33
Karthik SR,2020-10-21 12:58:16,"A well developed game, awesome visual effects, cool music and many more. Enhancements / requirements : Might need more info on what we need to do in making the character stronger like a demo at the start of game where we will learn about various enhancements/stuffs that are available rather than us surfing the internet to learn",Positive,329,57
Steven Pal,2020-10-17 23:02:11,"Great value it feels like a AAA game even though it's free. It does have its flaws though, the gacha, like other games is crazy even with the pity system. The late game depends on a very limited resource to play and after the initial free gems (premium currency) that you get in game there's no good way to get them, aside from the extremely small amount they give you daily. The in-store gems also cost a lot for very little value ($3=little more than 1 roll). The game is fun but needs work.",Positive,493,94
Nathan Balinas,2020-10-24 20:43:11,"Great Game in All Honesty but one word BATTLEPASS, When you reach Adventure Rank 20 it suddenly pops up with no way for free to play players to open it and don't get me started with the gacha system yikes.... I Love the Game, I Hate the Tactics they use to make you spend money cuz they know you will Update: I am almost Adventure Rank 40, Now the only reason I stayed is because of my friends and I will Give the game only a 4 because the Battle Pass is still unreasonable for Players who are F2P",Positive,497,99
Zarif Rafiz,2020-10-31 08:10:34,The game was tremendous but the camera movement and the landscape of the game is killing me sometime.,Positive,101,18
lorenzo Mamasig,2020-10-27 18:34:52,"Game is amazing, loot system is fair gameplay is satisfying. Further optimization is needed specially on the 60fps mode. I currently play on my Xiaomi Mi 9t pro with a Snapdragon 855(last year's flagship chip) there are some frame drops noticeable specially in combat and traversing the world ( I noticed frame drops when there are ai near) Overall the game's great needs little bit tweaking but very fun to play.",Positive,413,71
Free Stylz,2020-10-18 18:11:46,The game is really amazing. Like probably the best game I've played on Android. Only reason I didn't give it a full 5 star is because of the cutscene. Idk if it's because of the signal strength or something but the cutscene glitches for the most part with makes it really hard to enjoy it,Positive,288,55
Nabila Sella Almira,2020-10-27 10:45:34,"The artworks and the storyline are amazing, the characters are all loveable. But my only critic for this game is that, when it's supposed to be a cutscene, the app usually crashes or the cutscene will be so slow. Probably because the animation is too heavy, but overall, this is such a good game",Positive,295,54
Eric Casabay,2020-10-23 15:52:45,"Well its good overall but for one thing I have trouble at is the resin system and farming with the resin system is hard, like when you run out of resen you can't farm artifacts from domains making grinding time too long and will take days and also it becomes hard to level characters due to the lack of materials from farming and this all due to the resin system. In short run out of resin no more farming",Positive,405,79
Raylexson lol,2020-11-09 13:29:54,Great game overall. The optimisation is getting better. I hope it will become more smoother.,Positive,92,15
Izaazn20,2020-11-05 17:38:05,"Hearing the bad of genshin makes me feel frustrated whether i should continue playing this...the resin problem,In app purchases rates sky rocketing and nothing much to do end game (do commissions n waste ur resin in 13min) What I really hope will happen:- 1.Increase resin cap as you reach higher AR 2.balance the pricing of crystals in the shop 3.optimise and make controls adjustable and control support 4.Add more content double time",Positive,436,72
Flame,2020-10-22 05:57:24,"So, I've been playing ever since it's been released like the minute it got released, and I've spent 120hrs on this game. Its an amazing and beautiful mobile game, and probably in my opinion the most beautiful mobile game yet, maybe a bit of a stretch but y'know, but as all other games out there, this one is no different, it has a lot of flaws and bugs, like the resin system which really slows down progress, but hey I aint complaining too much, I'm not the type to rush, anyways amazing game 4/5.",Positive,499,94
Linus Patrick Yambao,2020-11-06 11:43:46,Very Good graphics and amazing game many who play zelda will also like it. And much more better because i can play on mobile phones much more convenient.,Positive,153,28
La Merveilleuse,2020-10-28 03:33:44,"The first 30 hours or so would be a very refreshing game to play, after that it's just the grind, the game is good but I think it was rushed and it needs some time to improve on content, I'm gonna come back when they add better content for the game or when a good chunk of the story is developed",Positive,295,61
SpontaneousLord 375,2020-11-14 00:48:12,Why need to download whole 5625 Mb whole game in a Update? The game is not Optimized for My SD 855 phone. The graphics are set on Medium 30 fps default and yet its does frame drop.,Positive,180,37

Chris Chester Aguilar,2020-11-08 19:57:11,"The graphics are very beautiful, the story, the characters look great. This could have been a 5 star if getting more heroes have a bit higher of a percentage because I got barbara 3 times and that is so unlucky for me. Over all great game recommended to players who haven't played this yet.",Positive,290,54
7C zaidannaim,2020-11-10 20:10:02,"need more improvement : the movement must be slightly altered so that it is not too stiff, make more gacha events and added a grapics setting, this game is nice tbh",Positive,164,31

remains memories,2020-10-25 07:24:06,"The game itself is very beautiful, and quite interesting too, however I don't see why it needs Internet connection when you're playing solo. It would be great if in upcoming updates there will be an option to play fully offline, because internet is not always available",Positive,269,46
Amadeus Astefanesei,2020-10-18 02:40:30,"Great game, but unfortunately the resin (stamina system) problem is too big. I play for about 20 minutes per day because the game simply doesn't allow me to do more. Also the F2P currency is extremely little and the rates are abysmally low. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because this game has insane potential, more than most games out there. If they manage to iron out the biggest problems then it's on track to be one of the best games in the last few years.",Positive,473,89
Ariel Wu,2020-10-23 21:09:39,"Not sure if im the only one experiencing this but i played this game for a while before i deleted it as exam was coming, and i made sure to link the account to both my facebook and email, but now when i log into my account using FB and email, all progression is lost and i have to restart. Kinda disappointed about the loss of progress, not sure if this can be fixed, but oh well even if it can't there is nothing i can do about it.",Positive,432,89

Patryck Fitch,2020-10-20 12:09:30,"I love this game. I can't give it 5 stars in good conscience, simply because I haven't been playing it for all that long, but I love the gameplay, the world, the story, the graphics, everything it great. The gacha elements don't make the game trivial with good drops, or unplayable without them, so I find it's pretty well balanced. It's obvious a lot of love and passion went into development, and I hope to stick with it for a long while to come.",Positive,448,84
JadeLeaf Ïü§ÎìúÎ¶¨Ìë∏,2020-10-18 04:36:29,"It's honestly one of the best mobile games I've ever seen AND played, I'm sure the resin or gacha system would need some tweaks in order to keep the game's audience, but as long as you go through the game at a moderate pace there shouldn't be any reason for u to need to spend money on such a high-quality and free to play game. It's truly breathtaking.",Positive,353,68

Josecuno TPS,2020-10-10 06:12:07,"I like this game so much, I really do. It's quite entertaining and all and it's got me hooked. The problems that I got however are the loading times when you boot up the game are quite long. I suppose that's to be expected, but the one thing that bugs me the most is that some cut scenes won't show out, like the starting cut scene or the cut scene where you fly to shoot the stormterror. Please fix this",Positive,404,80
Vinh Tran,2020-10-21 12:11:06,"A good game with bad lootbox system. Hope there is a better way than just roll to get the characters. Value for the lootbox is really expensive.

The only thing I would like to be possible is if you could make the character you mainly play, editable.

Tidward Squentacles,2020-10-19 14:59:35,"This has to be the best game I have ever played. The graphics, gameplay and story is amazing, but this means that you need a high-end phone or PC to play.

Wai Yan Paing,2020-10-30 03:13:35,"i think they should fix the camera angle during combat as well as the resin system. The main trouble is resin system.As the AR is grader,tasks and quests are fewer and finally nothing left to do but killing mini bosses.Though they're free to kill,elements get from those bosses aren't really great if they compare to elite bosses.But elites bosses need 40 original resins.I wouldn't be say anything if it needs 30 or lower resin.i started playing from Oct 1st and now i think i start boring.",Positive,491,86
Jamesskiii5,2020-11-07 23:39:45,A little bit better than honkai impact but I'm looking forward to updates since the game is not yet complete. I hope they would add content faster than people finishing the game as it is now cuz they might quit. After that this game would be the best this generation.

Adrian Vazquez,2020-10-22 05:23:09,"This is such a good game and is one if not the best most addictive gameplay and world in general but there's one thing I don't like, it doesn't have controller support or any way to at least move/map the controls in any way and I would like to use a controller in this game.",Positive,274,55
Saynee Goldfish,2020-10-22 09:32:02,"Dropped to 4 Stars because I literally ran out of things to do once I caught up on the Main Storyline. Even have all the Side Quests done so now it's just Daily Quests and grinding which gets old when that's all there is to do everyday and they become repetitive. Really would like to interact more with NPCs that need things done, quests, ingredients, money, etc for some kind of reward or achievement.",Positive,403,74

Josh Abbey,2020-10-28 01:02:59,One of the best gotcha games that you really don't even need to be a gotcha The only problem I have with the mobile version and the only reason it's not a five star review is that I constantly seem to be getting a sound bug where it just sounds garbled like like they blew my speaker but I double checked it's not my speaker but absolutely an amazing game everyone calls this breath of the waifu and it really is such a great game I've spent most of the time just like exploring it is a little grindy,Positive,500,99
Edmund Tong,2020-10-04 16:53:18,"Everything about the game is great. From the graphics to the performance, absolutely stunning and smooth....for the first day or two after release. Even after I get rid of all my background tasks and using Game Launcher, and on LOWEST settings my S20+ still gets uncomfortably hot. This shouldn't be happening on a top of the line phone, please optimise the game! The temperature is causing the rest of the game to throttle, leading to frame stutter and lag as well.",Positive,466,81
Brendan SimplyNeo,2020-10-01 10:19:12,"First going into the game I was met with a nice loading screen and animations. After having to play for about 2 hours I have gotten my conclusion.The gameplay is smooth with beautiful music. About the story, so far it's pretty enjoyable and the fact that you have the option to be able to teleport makes it even greater.As for pay to win, I havent felt underpowered yet but I can't say if this will happen later on though. But as for now its pretty good. Lastly I want to have controller support.",Positive,496,93
arkiteckht,2020-10-18 14:49:47,"Very great game, highly recommend if you like open world-rpg games. Love all the mechanics except for the level barrier. It's really only there to lengthen the game out. Also the fact you can't access multi-player earlier which isn't fun, especially since it's put behind a very high level barrier. The controls are simple and easy to use, but I hope they add controller support to make a better experience for us who prefer that style of gaming. Otherwise a really amazing game on mobile!",Positive,489,85

Sakuya Izayoi,2020-10-02 13:30:17,"The only flaw I find in this game, is that the Gachas rates for 5 Star units and items are Way too low, with some being at below 1%,which is an insanely low quota when pulling. Combined with the rarity of the pull-item, I find it a little unfair. However, the game still is pretty enjoyable as is.

Usage Resin more be effective like to claim reward from Domain and others 3. MATERIAL ASCENSION and MATERIAL ENCHANCMENT for now its hard to collect cause all of player would stay to for days 4.

Dave Shay,2020-10-19 19:02:11,I'll update my review if I can get into the game. The game locks up every 2% of trying to download 5.8GB of updates using Galaxy Tab A. I'm willing to give the download on my phone. Update - added stars as I can play now. The problem was I needed to exit out of Samsung Dex on my tablet. Download of updates stopped locking up once I did that.,Positive,343,70
Unknown Mystery,2020-10-02 15:40:21,"Great game so far, was looking forward to it I was expecting a so-so game. I'm glad there's VA's for majority of the content so far, can't really focus on reading flavor text anymore. Reason it's has 4 out of 5 stars is I made the account on Android but it was nearly unplayable due to the phone being out dated of course. There was no way to link the account to the pc version tell you get to a point in-game where you could use the settings menu. It wasn't far but with no frames it was too far.",Positive,497,100
Clara,2020-10-27 01:08:56,"Many people complaining about resin, but personally it fits my sched since I only play short times daily. I believe the resin system is well thought of, its just that some (cough) have tens of hours of time playing daily, consuming the game before the devs release new content. Slow down guys. Knocked down a star due to cumbersome controls on mobile. For instance, archers should have an auto aim for charged attacks.",Positive,418,73
parasaurolofun,2020-10-20 19:59:26,"I am enjoying the game, and I just finished Prologue I, but I do have a few issues with the game. For starters, even though I'm playing on the lowest graphical settings, the game still lags quite a bit, has long load times, and heats up my phone very fast. Another issue I have is with the controls. The joystick feels way to sensitive, and your character moves quite fast so I've found myself tumbling off cliffs without meaning to. I hope they add a setting in the game that can change that.",Positive,493,93
Eve,2020-10-26 20:55:23,Honestly its an amazing game the only reason im not giving it five stars is because there is an unfixed glitch when playing on computers and i believe on mobile that gets you stuck on the looking for updates screen and even if you re-install the game it doesnt fix and any of the fixes ive found are unofficial and dont seem to work so once thats fixed im definitely going to change my rating to 5 stars.,Positive,404,78
Kimani Velez,2020-10-24 11:32:06,"Beautiful game, detailed characters and fun gameplay. The main issue with this game is that the interface is a bit overwhelming.

William Yang,2020-09-30 06:18:19,"Fun to play, could've been a great premium single player game. Very similar to gacha games, rewarding those who grinds. Would love it if it had controller support, think archer class would benefit the most from this. Catching critters is hard. The prompt that shows up to catch them would show up to late as they already ran away. Another problem I had was looking for the settings menu. You have to advance in the game to get that.My issues with the game are minor especially when it just released.",Positive,499,90
Spider HQ,2020-09-29 01:14:17,"This game is if not the best game on the phone, it's definitely one of the best games. I seen a lot of games getting graphically good recently but none like this. It has a lot of Breath of the wild mechanics but it's still so different from it that it becomes it's own thing. Only issue I noticed so far is there is no controller support although the touch controls are still good just wish I could use a controller and if they add that support I would give 5 stars but for now it's 4 stars for me.",Positive,498,100

I hope there is a fix soon enough. Because I can see the amount effort put into them. Also the same thing happened while the game was downloading the files, the background kept stammering and freezing. Even at the lowest graphic option.

Daryl Wall,2020-10-26 07:07:47,"Great game. I know the urge to spend money is there late game, but so what. The quality deserves to be rewarded.

It has a huge map to explore, quests etc. The thing missing tho is people running around MMO style and pvp. This game has great potential. Fantastic sound, great graphics, very fun play. Elemental stuff sounds complicated at first, but for me hands on helped a lot.",Positive,369,71

( keep up with the rate up pools) My only gripe is that, this is a crossplay game but in Co-op mode is almost useless because the guest in the wold cant get like 90% of the available rewards.

Plays more like a dedicated handheld/console game than a mobile game. 2 hours in and I've not even been offered any IAPs, unlike the many other mobile games that bombard you with them as soon as the apps launch. Also no god-awful overwhelming menus and options. Feels like a AAA game and hard to believe it's free. Combat feels organic and immensely satisfying. 60 fps takes the visuals to another level.",Positive,488,84
Latest n Greatest,2020-10-03 21:53:20,"Its a fun game with great graphics, but could seriously benefit from being more difficult. Its easy to stunlock enemies and you dont really have to worry about health. EXP-giving items should be a lot harder to get, with EXP only being rewarded to the party member currently in play. Loot is way way too plentiful, and you prettymuch get op gear in an hour. Enemies should hit harder and faster, and they should add a ""stun bar"" that stuns when it fills up, maybe every 3 combos.

Bern Chyu,2020-10-03 03:05:03,"This is a cross platform game and PVE oriented with ""co-op"". Although it's beautiful and has a nice story it gets boring later. However, if you're free to play that won't happen for several months because getting just 1 team of 4 to max level will take a couple months. But end game requires several teams to be maxed for easier completion. To max out your characters you need to first rank up your level which is slowly raised overtime from exploring and doing quests. A lot of time or money is req",Positive,499,93
Icebox Sparkle,2020-09-30 23:17:15,"Great game! The only problem that's why I rated this 4 stars is because if you minimize the game for example you are going to read a messege or text and then you're going back to the game, it will restart the game.

Cb Aos,2020-10-25 04:58:53,"So much fun but takes a while to get used to the mechanics if you're not used to video games, but if you download it on a older electronic or one with almost no data some files don't seem to load, for me it was the eye shines of the ""player""",Positive,241,51
Mr Fox,2020-10-07 11:16:43,"Step aside Raid Shadow Legends, this is the game we wanted and needed. Not since Ravensword has a mobile game capitaved me as much as Geshin Impact. It's beautiful and smooth for a mobile game. A few gripes I have are that my phone burns hot enough to be classified as a fire-hazard and the controls feel a little awkward to use at first, but these gripes are understandable since it's on a device the size of a slice of bread. Give it a shot and fall in love. Genshin Impact for Switch 2020",Positive,491,94
Mark Gabriel Ritualo,2020-10-10 11:44:20,"The experience was excellent, but the game needs to optimize battery usage because it uses too much battery power when playing. It drains my battery. For example, I charged my phone fully but when I launch the game the battery drops to 96 just in the loading screen.

Graphics are good, story is decent, devs are responsive, community is thriving and a vast selection of characters. Content is lacking a bit on co-op mode but that is to be expected from a new game but what sold me is the element synergies and reactions. It just makes the fluid combat tactical and fun. This is how you make 3D animated characters work. I guarantee you won't find any other open world RPGs on mobile like this.",Positive,500,92
Julian Chua,2020-10-05 09:27:37,"Everything is amazing in this game. The only thing I really hope they would improve on is the enhancement system.

Tyler Beilke,2020-09-29 17:08:52,"The game itself is extremely good, fun and engaging. My only real gripe is the gacha mechanic is probably the most greedy and predatory I've seen of all the gachas I've played before. Thankfully the game is apparently able to be played through just fine with the free units, but it's still disheartening to have so many other units locked behind insanely high prices for the rates they have.",Positive,391,69

Story is cool but feels like it's being slowed down whenever it gets to the next big thing. As for the store, it's ok. I'm usually FTP but it's a bit empty right now anyhow. Plus no matter what you get from the gatcha your able to get something useful eventually.",Positive,420,82
Mercury Bitt,2020-10-14 20:01:46,"This game is absolutely incredible. I adore the art and gameplay. Even the story, though very realistic on anime tropes, is good, and I adore the characters. However, I do want to bring up that at the end of the day, this is a gatcha game. The gatcha mechanics can be extremely frustrating, and I still fully believe that the resin system needs reformed to make co-op more of a staple.

Blazing Hedge,2020-10-01 01:56:38,It is a very good game the one star reviews that the game has garnered are undeserved because what those players do not understand is that the game is still very fun and playable even if you aren't able to pull the character you want.

Some of the mechanics are a bit clunky and awkward on mobile but if I get stuck something that's to hard on my phone I just mark it on my map and do them on my PC later. So far I've been completely f2p and the game is completely playable with the free stuff so far. I'm adventure level 21 and have yet to hit any sort of pay wall.

Game looks great and has a large open world to explore. My only real gripe with the game is it's gacha system.

The adventure rank progression could be sped up a little and the adventure rank needed to play with friends should be 10 or 13 not 16. Also sometimes there's moments when vendors in towns won't load till you wait long enough and pull up a new menu to reset the personal UI.

Tami M,2020-10-14 02:18:25,"The biggest flaw with this game is the end game. You get stuck after level 30 grinding slowly, because practically everything you do is by your 120 resin (which slowly recharge over 16 hours). This makes the game much less appealing to play for long sessions once you burn through the regular story. And it makes no sense to spend Primogems on resin, which will recharge, instead of on gatcha pulls. Other than that, the only major gripe I have is the lack of controller support on mobile platforms. It seems like a no-brainer, since it is already on PC and PS4. It is nice that the game can be logged into on multiple platforms though, making this something I can pick up and play on the go, then take it to the bigger screen at home. Unfortunately, the PC version doesn't automatically switch the gaming input from keyboard to controller when one is plugged in, or remember the last saved input setting. And, it would have been nice to be able to use both keyboard AND controller inputs at the same time. If they integrate controller support for mobile, I hope that they allow options for removing the touch interface, or keeping it there so you can use both. All in all, this is a VERY impressive, fun, and addicting game with a beautiful world to explore. They pulled it off well, and the fact that they recouped their development costs in just a few days speaks for itself! Well done, hope to see some new content and minor tweaks in the future!",Positive,1450,264
JDGgamer DoesMobileGames,2020-10-13 19:47:51,The game is overall a really fun and amazing game that must have taken ages to make. The downside of the game is due to the gacha.

Sometimes it lags so hard (even in the lowest graphics)but when it works (like most of the time) it stays like 60fps constant with medium graphics.

Munchies romero,2020-09-30 01:36:14,"This is one of the greatest mobile games I've ever played. Story is good, graphics look good for a mobile game, so many things to do, and it's a massive open world. But still I'm only giving it 4 stars because i hate playing with touch screens, and there's currently no üéÆMOBILE CONTROLLERüéÆ support yet. I know this game just came out, but I would support this game 100% if you updated this game later on to allow players to play with mobile game controller, and that would make this game PERFECT",Positive,495,92
Rinaldy,2020-09-30 13:45:29,"Fix your camera controls, or add an option to turn auto camera or something like that. It always resets my aim everytime I run from bosses. Also, when fighting bosses that has an attack pattern that needs to be dodge, I always need to control and hold the camera and my movement at the same time which is annoying AF. Other than that, everyting is great.",Positive,354,66
Tonquese Commander,2020-09-28 21:42:17,"Game Is beautiful, simple and well designed. However, I'm not a fan of limiting simple actions like reviving one character with cooldown though. It limits gameplay and makes it harder to enjoy the game. If I could revive my entire party and then have to wait, it would make more sense at least. The gameplay is interesting and I hope this game continues to do well.",Positive,365,66
Vernon lim,2020-10-08 17:00:13,"Reallh good, but the problem is it takes a lot of batery in my phone, easy to heat. But its ok since its an mmorpg open world. Yeah bcs of that i can only grind for 1 hour than charge. Even when i am charging, it wont go up. Then the gacha is good. Really hard to get 5 star. Still get good chara though. I wanted to play on ps but dont have it. The main problem is the servers. I didnt know the servers doesnt share data, i cant play with my friend cuz dif servers. Is thre any way to play with them",Positive,500,106
Helga Damaris,2020-10-05 15:18:10,"Good game that reminds me of early BOTW experience and the graphic is really beautiful even at lowest setting, along with music and etc. But the game often force close randomly, which is a let down. Hopefully it can be fixed soon. Gacha is...nice but also eh. Just like usual gacha game experience. 4/5 bc it always force close on my phone. Thats all.",Positive,351,64
Andres Villasmil,2020-10-11 23:20:33,"From what ive played it looks and feels really good, but if you dont own a tablet or a powerful phone then its best to ignore it. Even after lowering everything in config it burnt my battery at the speed of a lambo. I had to log out shortly after getting amber because my phone was burning. and I had to run it 3 times to play (the 2nd one reset my phone). Its best for the devs to focus on optimization, as the game already has A LOT of content",Positive,445,91
Thomas Zeng,2020-10-01 06:49:49,"Pretty good. I've only played the intro, but its very smooth and the controls are pretty good. There were a few audio glitches where there was static sound and a few cutscenes froze up. But I'm sure these bugs will be patched out. I also wish there was an option to rescale some of the buttons as the buttons on the top of the screen are just way too small. It would also be nice if the controls supported gyroscope aiming especially for the bow. Otherwise though, I've really enjoyed it.",Positive,488,91
Enzo Rodrigues,2020-10-03 04:24:09,"The gacha rates are atrocious (0,6% for a 5 stars character when you need multiple copies to unlock features is insane), but the game itself it's pretty fun and delightful. In other gacha games that I played that need dupes for upgrades have rates around 10% for SSR/5 stars. If the game didn't need dupes, the rates won't be so troublesome, but honestly seems almost impossible to draw multiple of the same 5 stars characters even in the long run.",Positive,448,80
Brian Roldan,2020-09-28 11:12:46,"My only issue with it so far? Audio sometimes has a problem, where any time anything makes a sound, or someone speaks, it sounds like static or popping in the background. My phone (Galaxy 10e) hasn't had this problem, except for one other game. And it can get rather irritating to deal with. Especially since its every single word or sound. Please fix quickly!",Positive,360,64
Ruel John Alimon,2020-10-09 21:28:43,"Game is meant to be played as a single player experience. If you're planning to play this as mostly coop you'll be disappointed. The daily stamina(resin) is so limited, it takes 15 hrs. to fully refill and depending on the a task it consumes 1/6 to 1/2 of your daily max stamina in a single task, those tasks burn out quicker in coop however in a singe player perspective it's great because those tasks takes quite a while to do As a single player game it's one of the best MMO I've played this year",Positive,499,95

Wc Nuggets,2020-09-30 09:47:15,"The game is amazing, beautiful graphics, cool characters and a great story! I do have some problems though, I feel it is too much because I have to play with a charger plugged in and it still loses battery, the cutscenes freeze no matter what quality I'm on. My biggest problem in game is the adventure rank leveling up, it takes hours to level it up just one level. And the ratio between the amount you get from doing things is a little off.",Positive,442,84
PaladinEX,2020-10-05 16:12:56,"At first, I have never played a game like this, but man, it gave a good first impression and I love playing it right now. the ability to choose how the game looks through the graphics customizer is a very good touch, great gameplay, a little descriptive on how things work, but you start to understand quickly and simplify it in your own way. Only problem is that sometimes the cutscenes freeze and the audio kinda splices itself and I cant make out what it says, like a CD skipping. Great Game guys!",Positive,500,93
Jessica Fuller,2020-10-04 07:16:02,"This is NOT ZELDA. And I LOVE IT. Seriously, I love love love Zelda, this game seems to have everything it takes for long term addiction without regret.

Sazuvik2,2020-10-04 08:16:23,"So far, this is the best mobile RPG I played in my whole life! This game gives me Zelda vibes but with their own stuff in it! 1 problem though, I was sprinting around the village then I glitched in the stairs and I'm unable to sprint again. Please fix this on the next update, developers! Also release it on Nintendo Switch, I'm excited!",Positive,337,64
sterbux,2020-09-29 14:24:36,"Only a few performance issues, sided with the fact that it eats phone charge for breakfast, but in spirit of that this game is incredible. You see mobile games claim to be AAA quality all the time, but this game lives up to that reputation, this bizarre amalgam of the impact series alongside a breath of the wild feel is a breath of fresh air for mobile games",Positive,360,68
Ice Edits,2020-10-22 13:57:18,The game is amazing but I hope that controller support for the mobile version like the pc version. Hope it comes in the future. Also for the characters that you use in the open world their eyes don't have any movement or the light that it usually has for android.,Positive,263,50
Carmine Iannone,2020-10-07 17:41:13,"The game is really fun and flashy. But the speed at which you earn premium currency is extremely slow, as well as it being overpriced if you buy it with real money. But I never feel I need to spend money to progress, as it only unlocks new characters to play as, so I'm not that upset. As for how the app runs on mobile is a different question I have a note 8, (imo thats a pretty new device), unfortunately the game crashes often and constantly suffers from frame rate drops and performance issues.",Positive,499,95
Christopher Wigley,2020-10-06 10:02:55,"For a brand new game it is really well done with only a few hiccups here an there. The controls need some tuning, for example adding a button for climbing would be nice. Also disabling the automatic camera movement would be really nice and being able to turn off auto-target would be great but otherwise this game is wonderful!",Positive,327,59
Rifqi Jauhari,2020-09-30 23:09:51,"It's indeed a good game like anyone said, but for me it's a bit empty since this game is an open world game and there's a lot of space everywhere but not so many people around And i thought this game is an mmo, but nope it's just an rpg with co-op feature, well...should be more fun with more people to hang around with you know...",Positive,331,66
Put TheTiming,2020-10-15 11:12:11,"I love it, but I have one small complaint I can run the game in Low 30 fps (Xiaomi redmi note 8T), and... One thing triggers me a little I can't turn off the shaders to win frames I mean c'mon, the grass is still fancy even if I want it gone? The ability to turn off shaders would make a lot more people able to play the game If this would be added, or other stuff for improving performance (like a lower render distance option) my review would go back to 5 stars because I love this game",Positive,488,99
Noctis Caelum,2020-10-08 12:36:40,"The game starts off strong, open world adventure with rpg elements. Gives you enough to get you the base of the game without needing to rely on gachas. Tons of exploration and collectables to find. However, after exhausting this the gameplay loop is a bit lacking. Leveling requires grinding randomly spawning chests, daily commissions, and running very limited dungeons. It goes from a full game back to mobile once exhausted, as finding random low level chests is long and unfulfilling.",Positive,488,80

The biggest reason to rush is probably the battle pass. 4 Stars and in future maybe 5.",Positive,348,68

Sammantha Aus,2020-10-01 09:59:33,"Good RPG game, reminds me of Breath Of The Wild big time, then Witcher 3, Skyrim, and Sword Art Online honestly, I'm curious how the story is since I'm visually comparing it to those games. I just got to the first city but couldn't play anymore due to glitches and constant freezing. Even restarting the app and phone didn't help. Story seems good so far. 4 stars because constant glitching which takes away from the experience. Controls seem alright, takes getting used to.",Positive,474,83

Being able to interact between all 4 from 3rd person as the fight and explore would be better than switching 1at a time. Phone's a little toasty but playable. A clear action notification for things like climbing would be nice-its annoying to sprint too close to a wall- climbing. Camera pan needs to stay where u angle it. Target Lock-on would be handy.",Positive,498,95

I just notice that you cant keep your data if you change servers and i dont think i want to waste my time doing my best to beat those hard enemies again, so i lost some of my motivation to play.

Please make it possible for enemies to die if they fall from somewhere high up. If I fall, I die, but if an enemy falls, they get teleported back to their original spot and their health bar it restored, which is beyond annoying.",Positive,463,88

Triple Helix,2020-10-04 19:30:05,"Great art direction, runs fine most of the time. I believe the game needs controller support or a way to rearrange onscreen controls. Also needed for more fun exploring the world space would be variable walking and running speed. (For an example of high tier movement check mobile game Sky).

Heloise Eloisa,2020-10-16 00:35:05,Really good so far. You need to work hard to find the chest and di quest to level up as a rank adventurer. You also need to think what to use and prioritize so the game is good for me so far. No need to pay money to grt characters too. Need more farming that's it!

Jason Barksdale,2020-09-29 09:12:02,"It's a gacha style RPG, it is a great game and I expect more to come. It did have some flaws thought. The story being locked behind a experience wall takes away from the story telling aspect forcing me to grind just to continue the story. Klunky aim controls and sometimes random spikes in frames hindered the experience, forced grind periods where enemies are 10 levels higher than you, and take almost 2 minutes to beat, and the required internal storage needs to be specified needing 6gb to play.",Positive,499,89

If you idle for more than a minute the characters idle is annoying & loud. Too many currencies. There are 5-6 & a battle pass once you reach level 20.

Sebastian Bart,2020-10-11 03:14:37,I really like the game it everything that a free game should be and it feels like a payed game. The gach system is not too good but they have a way for me to grind for what I need but I think they should give some base characters for free like one for element. They did do that for 3 so far I saw but not too sure about the other element. Love the game and can't wait for session events to be add. I would like to see a pet or spirit following me to add to vibe. Make a four like animal to play as.,Positive,498,108

Next, leveling up seems repetitive, hopefully, variety of ways to level up would be added. Lastly, I hope there is an alternative way to get new characters or weapons!",Positive,387,66
Eben Goldstein,2020-09-29 05:14:44,"I would've given this 5 stars if the control icons were dimmable. From playing PUBG (a lot) I have ""Alive"", ""Killed"", the backpack icon, the vest and helmet icons permanently burned into my S8 screen. Genshin doesnt offer the option to move controls around or to make them more transparent which makes it a potential screen killer. Other than that the game is really good and the graphics are beautiful.",Positive,403,70
Jgouken,2020-10-02 12:06:41,"This game is phenomenal. Graphics are incredible, gameplay is nicely packed, and the story is intriguing. However, this is just me, but I would like more abilities. Not like more classes like Air and Water, but more ways to use them. Each character does have their own set of abilities, but adding more would make this game so much for strategy intense and fun. Some powers can be weaker than others at some points, and some may just give a small boost.",Positive,453,82
itzdylanyo,2020-10-04 12:41:18,"This game is phenomenal and I dont want to put it down. It IS a bit of a battery drain, but for the amount of game that your phone is rendering, put the charger on and go at it. The graphics are wonderful, the music is amazing, the AI is challenging but not unbeatable, especially at lower levels. The characters are super balanced and the damage is weight-y. My only complaints with the game are that it needs Bluetooth controller (specifically PS4 controller) and to increase the exp dropped.",Positive,494,89
Jessie Liu,2020-10-06 13:29:19,Gameplay is smooth and very intuitive. I really love the system of combining elements to make extra effects happen. Not a new concept but very nicely executed. Plays much better on PC. You can't cross save to/from PS4 but can cross play. The gacha rates are completely abysmal. I went in thinking I wouldn't bother rerolling but by day 3 I learned how Spiral Abyss is impossible for F2P characters.,Positive,398,70
Wand wand,2020-10-08 00:30:47,"Already play the game till rank 10. I like the game that's can give us a freedom too jump and climb anything. And i like the story and the voice actor, they're really good. But the downside of this game is, this game is really heavy for phone that's using SD 636 so i just can using the lowest graphics that's means the graphics is about like 360p or 480p. And more downside is, the gacha rate really bad .... Hope this game can be more friendly for mid-phone in the future.",Positive,474,92
Paul Mckim,2020-10-19 16:54:48,"This is a surprisingly good game, amazing graphics and gameplay. One thing I'd love to see added is controller support across all mobile versions as touch controls have never been comfortable to me, I'd give this 4 stars 5 if they add controller support.",Positive,254,44
Robert Gioia,2020-10-06 09:42:34,Game is very fun and graphics are gorgeous. Wish it was easier to get the currency for the gatchas by gathering but I understand that's how they're making money since the game is free otherwise. Controls on the phone are a bit awkward. I feel the touch 'joystick' is too far towards the center of the screen. If it was the floating style that centered where you touched the screen in the bottom left corner it would be better. I mainly play this on PC anyways so not a huge deal for me.,Positive,486,93
Mathew Capaccio,2020-10-02 16:38:22,"I love this game, but it has two major flaws in it. The first one being is there is no control support for the game, which they could of implemented from their PS4 version. I would play this on my phone more if I could just have that experience like the PS4 does. The second major problem is that you cant cross-play this at all with the PS4, but you can from mobile to pc. I don't see why I just cant log into my playstation account through my phone, or sign in to Google from my PS4 to enable it???",Positive,500,101
Dilip Debnath,2020-09-29 23:55:49,The game is exceptionally good! Yet I am facing a sever problem as whenever I on my screen recorder while playing the game the game sound dissable! i know its not my phone's issue as I used to play other games with recorder on and never have that issue!

Spencer Conde,2020-10-03 07:52:09,"Great game, not exactly comfortable with games like this as I tend to get dizzy after playing for some time, despite that, I can say it's really great.

Quazi Aseer Faisal,2020-10-07 16:41:20,Really great game. Enjoying it a lot. Hard to believe this is a mobile game when the production quality is so high. Though must say the game is a battery hog also it takes up so much space. But all of that is worth it. And it's a really free to play friendly game. So that's great too. Loved it. Hopefully they would keep the game this enjoyable with further updates.,Positive,367,71
V0LT,2020-10-05 10:50:51,"Incredible story experience with some of the most complex and fun gameplay out there. The stamina system is one of the only gameplay features that suck, especially climbing and recharge. The gacha system is incredibly unforgiving and although I understand that it is completely optional and they need to make profit, spending hundreds for 1 5* character and thousands to max it out is WAY too excessive. Good game, terrible gacha system.",Positive,437,72
Lena Lopez Lara,2020-09-29 08:17:24,"The game is pretty good, nice graphics, runs smoothly and its fun to play. However the biggest problem is the lack for controller support.

Graeme Tang,2020-10-09 01:07:57,"Entirely addicting and breathtaking for the first few days I've been playing so far at least but I have concerns about end game content... I'm also experiencing an audio bug that some others were mentioning where it gets choppy after a few minutes of gameplay (I'm on a Pixel 3), otherwise it runs impressively smoothly for such an intense game. Highly recommend at least trying this!",Positive,384,66
Gabriel Rodeffer,2020-10-03 10:10:34,"Probably the best open-world exploration experience you can have on mobile. This game takes a lot of influence from series such as Zelda and NieR, and if you enjoy both titles you'll feel right home here. It's far from perfect. -1 star for the inclusion of microtransactions, which of course, makes the game pay-to-win. I wish this was limited to cosmetics and convenience items only. Also wish there would be some customization options for the main playable character (skins, outfits, ect.)",Positive,491,81
Greenwhatevers,2020-09-29 10:46:10,"This is a good game. I have this on pc, and I love it. I have just ended my first day of playing this game and I have already sunk 9 hours into it. But, I would not recommend trying to play the game on phone. If you absolutely have to, then I recommend you use a gaming phone with ram and maybe graphics card. And then wait untill they have Bluetooth controller support. I would reccomend this app for inventory sorting, quest reward collecting and expeditions. That's what I'm using it for.",Positive,491,93
ElectricaVulpes,2020-10-11 11:26:31,"I love this game, but playing on mobile is terrible. The controls are fine, but the game will force logout if you loose signal even if for a minute. Also, it burns through data like crazy. After just a few days of playing this, I noticed that my data usage is at over 20gb. Which is insane, because when I finished installing the game, I wasn't even at 1gb of data used, as I had just hit a new billing cycle the day I installed the game. I suggest just adding the ability to play without internet.",Positive,498,97

I can see that thr graphics is very cool and the storyline is also cool, I just started it so I don't know the storyline yet. And one thing is that please focus on server first because I'm having a severe lag issue, I never had it while playing mobile legends or call of duty: mobile and especially toram online which has 10m players, so please fix it because you can't enjoy the graphics whem there's lag.

I was afraid that the moblie version would be worst compared to the PC and PS4 counterpart but I was wrong! But there are improvements that need to be addressed. I don't know if it's just me but the game would occasionally freeze every 30 mins of play time. I usually play on max settings, 60 fps on my Galaxy S10 Plus. Even on medium settings, the game will still crash and freeze my phone",Positive,483,89
Alonso Herrera,2020-09-29 06:09:26,"I'm not too far in, so I guess it might still be ruined but: this is the best game on the app store after Minecraft, hands down. The combat feels incredibly fluid, and works pretty damn well on a touchscreen, the graphics are really pretty and definitely pushing what phones can display, the movement (albeit a little flawed) feels more than good enough and the open world works well. The music is great, but the implementation needs work. The open world is a bit closed off, which I don't love.",Positive,495,90
Samuel Bernath,2020-10-17 00:31:17,"Great experience overall. I really wish it would be more mobile friendly, seeing that even with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10, it could only take up to 45 fps on all medium settings.

Justin Silverman,2020-10-10 06:35:32,"Review is on android. Good rpg with some similarity in it's movement mechanics to botw. Solid gameplay, but I am too annoyed by how slow the game is to give you the option to pick up items to give it 5 stars. Have to be standing over lootable items for about 10 full seconds before the game recognizes that it should put up the item pick up button. Other problems are the ease with which you might fire off an attack or ulti while trying to move the camera.",Positive,457,89

NanoMyte,2020-09-30 19:30:19,I would like to rate this a 5 because the game is great and all and the experience and visuals are outstanding. My concern is that the game used a lot(and i mean a lot)of battery for 1 hour of gameplay.20% per hour and most phones quickly heat up because of the ram and processor getting used.

I love the fact that I don't see other players too xD. Makes it feel more personal.,Positive,435,87
James Alexander-Whaley,2020-10-06 06:56:03,"Great game but the controls could use some work. The gacha system is pretty good. You are guaranteed a 5 star every 90 pulls, and every other 5 star pull you are guaranteed the feature character. Which is üëå. The story is very interesting and I can't wait to see what happens next. Start now before 1.1 comes out to get some great characters and items.",Positive,351,66
Alvin Dale Bargamento,2020-10-01 14:30:21,"4 star but wouldve been a 5... The game gets harder once you reach AR 20+ and to boot the only recovery items you can have is the one's you can cook(which ingredients has to be manually procured) or to teleport directly to a statue for full heal(which is a no if you are trying to take down an elite monster or boss). The game couldve been a 5 star if recovery food items can be directly bought from a store and still have the option to cook them manually. Nevertheless, a great game.",Positive,484,94
Dummma,2020-10-05 12:26:49,"The game was amazing but I want just one feature implemented in the future, the ability to log in via Google on the pc version, because I have made alot of progress on mobile but I want to play on pc more so I would like it if this feature was implemented.

JestfulCompany,2020-09-29 23:59:38,"I didn't expect ""Legend of Anime, Breath of the Gacha"" to be so good... The combat is good and I was surprised by the quality of the graphics.

Jus Mechanics,2020-09-29 07:29:42,I really love it. I mean the logic of this game is very on point. I rarely make a ratings a ratings in RPG games. I mean this literally the 2nd time I rate a game in playstore. Everything thing is perfect for me. I just want to suggest if you boost the fps of the game. I mean like make am option that can enhance the fps the game. It is almost perfect üòç,Positive,354,75
Kevin Kurniawan,2020-10-14 18:58:29,"Possibly one of the best mobile gameplay I've experienced. But the problem is, character gacha rate (especially 5*) is very low and diluted by weapon dupes. Can you balance out the rate a bit more because no one needs dupe 3* weapons when they pull gacha 10x Also, too little resin given. I think players would appreciate if they can get extra 60- 120 resin per day",Positive,365,67
Maria Leano,2020-10-10 05:02:31,"This game has pretty much taken over my life rn. The characters are cute, the dialogs entertaining enough I take time to do side quests and the combats is a good enough challenge but still easy enough that its not hair pulling. The one reason that this isn't 5 stars? LET US PET THE ANIMALS IN TOWN. The dogs are adorable and sometimes follow you, and the cats are super cute too and sometimes I'll stop and stare at them for like 5 minutes.",Positive,441,84
Azis R Muraegi,2020-09-29 16:35:29,"Great open word game with anime style. The gameplay is more than I expected. Can jump, glide and climbing. Is almost area on word map can be explore. Battle system also good, no auto so you must do manually. Also you need understand about basic element cause it can be chained attack. Just for spec of pc and Android phone need more little consider. I use my old Xperia XZ1, can run but need to restart first and need more patient on first loading. Overall is great game. Play on PS4 for simple.",Positive,495,93
Olaes Rodolfo,2020-10-25 13:00:23,Everything in this game is very good it was many features in the game but the thing makes you stop farming is resin we need faster resin refreshments it take 16 hrs to fully charged resin from 0 to 120 and it takes too much time it much better if you can make it to 1 resin per 6 min and also please increase the maximum capacity you can send in expedition 3 to 4,Positive,363,75
Chocolate Stars,2020-10-02 21:31:25,I really like this game but for some reason I get stuck at the same scenario where it always shows black screen and the sound continues playing and then I get forced to quit the game and restart again please fix this issue. I also have another issue where the game lags and crashes and then I also get forced to quit I can't even play the game for 5 minutes because I always get forced to quit...,Positive,396,78
Akira Sato,2020-10-10 10:52:21,The game is interesting but there is one thing i cannot get out of my head is how much is resembles legend of zelda breath of the wild. This is not a bad thing to take inspiration from the game because its a wonderful game mad hits all around the world. Its nice to see the world taking hint from big titles like LOZ to better get a idea to give to the community. But overall solid game only reason i gave 4 stars is just some of the controls need work like random attaching to the trees etc.,Positive,492,99
Steeldragonz Bloodfeud,2020-09-29 04:20:30,"im loving it so far, the only reason im not giving 5* right now is that I honestly feel that controller support is needed. With that i would have no issues. My reason for this is that as someone with mobility issues holding the phone for periods in the way needed to play can cause me immense pain. Otherwise great job.",Positive,319,61
Blazion 56,2020-09-29 20:47:26,Absolute amazing game brilliant graphics and the gameplay is challenging just as i wanted these type of games to be. It truly is the first proper open world game that I've experienced on mobile. The sheer size of the whole package is a worth trade of for this beauty. Although the only thing i can say that slightly annoys me is the fact that some areas aren't too optimised even tho I have a snapdragon 845 which is recommended device specs,Positive,441,81
Marc Espina,2020-09-29 01:19:36,"It would be more fun if you can join your friends world and continue your quest there not just roam around and follow him like you're there for nothing.

Kian Ocampo,2020-09-29 00:35:26,"This game is absolutely amazing even thought my graphics are very low it still looks good and the gameplay is really really amazing as well, but my only problem with this game is that every time a monster shows up my fps drops, I hope that there's a way to fix this cause it's really my only problem with this game.",Positive,315,61
Fact you in particular,2020-09-29 12:27:12,the gameplay and concept was really good. I have some minor issues though... I am having a hard time fighting.

Overall I really liked the game :D lot of hidden chest.,Positive,324,61
Battle Beauty,2020-09-30 01:44:28,"It's such a fun and beautiful game. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of Co-Op. That's another big part of the game but you are severely limited on what you can do. You can't open chests, talk to people, grab sprites, you can't really do much of anything. Even the dungeon system with co-op seems a little wonky. I'm happy with the game aside from this huge dislike. I really hope the devs decide to rework co-op to make it more intriguing to play. As of now, it's kind of driving me away.",Positive,500,97
D√Æck H√©√†d,2020-10-26 22:51:39,"Loved this game but have issues as usual.

Kasey Beaton,2020-10-15 19:09:02,Love the game. Have been playing it alot since release. Great exploration and combat. Ranking up your adventure rank is a tad slow but you really don't even notice cause your always busy in game. However I can only rate this game 5 stars cause of the EXTREMELY LOW drop rate on 5star stuff. I've done quite a few summons and never broke 4 stars. The game will tempt you to spend money to do more pulls faster cause you arnt getting anything good I caution against this.,Positive,469,88
mario santiago,2020-10-21 06:19:43,This is the best game ive ever played on my mobile. But it has too much lag whenever i explore the whole map. I think one problem is the (RENDERING DISTANCE)...

CJ Anderson,2020-10-13 03:05:52,"The gameplay and graphics are fantastic! And from what I've seen so far, the story is too.

Lee Henderson,2020-10-05 01:04:43,"I love the game, however I have issues running this at 60fps consistently on my phone, my device isn't being thermal throttled, the game just bugs out to 30fps and the sliders don't work until I mess around with the performance settings randomly until 60fps with max settings work again. Also the gyrosensitivity when ADS feels a bit stiff, I have to turn my entire upper body for precise aiming, angling the phone would be more comfortable, can there be a gyro-sensitivity control as well?",Positive,490,85
Josh brinton,2020-10-15 08:05:35,"It's pretty good. I'd recommend playing on PC if you have that option as it's much smoother, but mobile is also pretty decent. Only complaint is the primogems, on a daily basis you can just about earn enough for 1 wish, and that's with grinding for them for hours per day. I think there should be some sort of way to get at least 1 wish per day, or making primogems easier to get/increasing the quantity at which you find them",Positive,426,81

Very addicting!",Positive,345,63
Zero Cool,2020-10-12 04:59:28,"Good game lags on my Razer phone 2, even on my home gigabit internet, both on pc and phone. The lack of controller support makes this a fun but not great game, as on screen controls aren't the same. The pc version has controller input which leads me to believe the xinput is already in the game code. If I could use my fly wee pad or razer jungle cat this would help me play for hours.

Catty Keels,2020-10-06 09:23:07,"Genshin Impact is probably the best open world ANIME RPG you will find in this time. The characters are interesting and diverse, the elemental system adds a lot of depth to combat and the story will make you want to keep playing!

Aidan Wilkinson-Leonard,2020-10-15 06:11:23,"This game is one of the prettiest on the mobile market. It's fun, is full of laughs, and has some pretty decent storytelling. The voice acting is great, but the characters are very chatty. But aside from the nitpicky stuff, this game runs like it's on a 1992 Windows computer. It takes forever to do anything. That's the only reason this review isn't 5 stars, and you should steer clear if you don't have a computer or a gaming phone.",Positive,434,80
christian lamb,2020-10-05 20:23:36,"Amazing game, one of the best currently on mobile. My only complaint is the controls.

frie s,2020-10-10 14:05:25,It's an awesome game and the animation is amazing as well. The only thing that is annoying is when u want to change party members . Having to click so many things is bothersome it would be nice to have a fast feature that once you click an arrow or something u can have the other four party members in an instant. One more thing is when wanting to pick something up u have to stand there for a while until it let's u pick it up. But over all good gameplay and cute characters.,Positive,476,95
Brandon Walker,2020-10-11 06:51:58,"Controls could be smoother, and characters could definitely be a little more balanced, but my biggest gripe, and only reason I took a star off, is my daughter really enjoys this game, but has a hard time on some missions, but I can't co-op with her for missions because apparently having that option would be detrimental somehow to the people who don't want to use it.",Positive,368,66
Tyreke Townley,2020-09-29 02:35:20,"The game is fun, combat is smooth and graphics are amazing even on low settings. One thing i will say that needs attention is optimization, my phone is an LG G7 ThinQ which is capable of running most games at max settings averaging 30-50fps, when on fully low settings for this game there is stilm lots of lag and stutters especially during cutscenes. It had gotten so bad that the audio clipped out and i missed the entire scene while a loud screeching sound was all i could hear. Still a good game.",Positive,500,93
Jo√£o Victor,2020-10-03 11:44:15,"This game is amazing! The graphics are spectacular and with a vast world to explore, full of small events to complete and quests to do, it's an experience you would expect from a AAA game like dragon's dogma. The combat is also very well made, with its characters and elements combinations that play in a way that is really novel. The gliding system is also a really cool way of exploring the world.",Positive,399,73
Brandon Ross,2020-10-03 20:47:39,"Still working on the game, but thought I should give an update. I have only spent $5 on this game so far and I feel like there is no need to spend anymore than that in order to keep progressing. This game is a tone of fun to play and explore in. However controller support is a must along with the ability to adjust Y Axis sensitivity. Those are two giant quality of life improvements that need to come soon. Will update this review again later.",Positive,445,86
Davon Phoenix,2020-10-02 10:56:01,"This take on a mobile RPG that's also sort of like a Gacha game is actually very dope. I usually don't like that style of game but you've hooked me with this awesome playstyle. It plays like an RPG similar to The Legend of Zelda BOTW. I can tell so much work was put into this and I'd highly recommend this to any and everyone who enjoys RPG style games.

I don't say any about graphic because Mihoyo is doing great on graphics. The combat they add one good things is the powers of the elements in the game can combine and have different effects make we can play some combo to let the combat become more interesting.

Freya Angelica Kardefelt,2020-10-05 10:42:32,"Genshin Impact has surprised me. I'm very critical of mobile games and the business practices associated with them, and while Genshin Impact isn't perfect, it's the best mobile game I've seen by far. When I initially saw Genshin Impact, my major concerns were: Business model, paywalls, overall gameplay and how they handled the quite obvious inspiration from The Legends of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Starting off with the business model. It's a gacha game, which is already a fair bit of a negative, I will never not speak out about psuedo-gambling mechanics and business models as they're inherently exploitative. Genshin's business model is... Okay for a gacha game. my biggest problem with it is that there are weapons in the gacha, where most players would prefer more of a focus of characters, putting weapons in feels like filler, and there are weapons only available from the gachas, separate from those which drop throughout the world. Now, onto paywalls. I've completed the story by now, and have not encountered any real paywalls. All progression is tied to ingame activities. Some materials however are in dungeons where you need a regenerating resource to open the final chest, and this resource has a rather low upper roof, and doesn't regenerate very quickly. The maximum amount being 120, refilling from 0 in 16 hours and I've encountered chests that cost 60 to open and this resource, can be refilled with premium currency. And then there's the gameplay, where this game actually shines! The game is a 3D action RPG, with a gorgeous artstyle that, while clearly inspired by Breath of the Wild is visually unique. Combat is fluid and fast, with every character having a weapon type and two abilities belonging to an element, and the combat system is a pretty good hack and slash affair at its base, with a dodge move to support it. Beyond the weapon combat there is an element combination system, where you swap between characters mid-fight and use the environment for new effects, in the rain, ice characters will freeze them solid, and electric attacks will cause them to chain lightning between each other, you can set fire to them and then electrocute them triggering an explosion and more! The game setting is a huge open world with plenty of secrets, collectibles and challenges all over the place, it's quite busy! My one BIG complaint here is that the game limits where you can explore pretty harshly right at the start, tying you down to a small part of the first area. What makes this extra puzzling is that the world is very obviously set up to be explored, just like Breath of the Wild, but unlike BOTW which opens up to a larger world very quickly, and tutorialises by showing instead of telling. Genshin Impact starts by pretty much railroading you down tutorial lane towards the first boss, with most optional quests (if not all) being locked! And nothing is more frustrating than spotting a new secret or puzzle and then being forced to turn around mere moments before you reach it. Now, on to that BOTW inspiration. In most places it's quite well executed, flying around with the glider, freezing water with ice characters to make paths, thawing frozen flowers with fire and cooling burning flowers off with ice so you can pick them up, but there's some points where they missed why BOTW did a thing, and put it in without thinking. The map is revealed through statues instead of towers, the towers in BOTW not just being there for revealing parts of the map, but as a lookout point, to help you explore, without putting markers on your map like most games. Lastly, the story. It's pretty alright. Nothing revolutionary, but has its moments. Pretty good dialogue, but in some cases, at least if you pick the female character it seems they've put in the wrong takes for some dialogue, subtitles not matching the dialogue and during some cutscenes you hear your brother being called your sister, and I encountered one case where two characters said the same line, one after the other. Oh and no controller support, which I feel is urgently needed.",Positive,4079,701

Taya Seloria,2020-10-10 02:31:42,This game is a must play. The graphics are clean and controls are simple enough. The reason why I gave 4 stars is that your phone quickly gets hot and the battery drains fast. There is also some server lag if you go though an area with lots going on (like cities).

Heinn,2020-10-04 22:47:56,"Probably one of the best free games out there, I was blown away by the quality and quantity of things to do in it, especially for a free game. No ads and despite there being a shop it isn't forced down your throat at every turn, which actually makes me want to throw some bucks at the game. Gameplay is really solid, there's voice acting in multiple languages (!), graphics (and aesthetics) are really solid , all is well BUT ... ... the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars it's because despite having control support on PC and obviously PS4 it doesn't have it on Android, which seems like a nobrainer to me. Once and if they fix that this will probably be my go-to phone game and get 5 stars.",Positive,691,132
Shane Richardson,2020-09-29 07:15:10,So far I am loving this game!!! This is a console level video game experience on my phone and the shop hasn't been intrusive enough to make me feel like I'm forced to spend money to enjoy myself. My only problem so far is that some times the game boots up in portrait mode instead of landscape and I have to restart multiple times to change it back. If this can be fixed this'll be a 5 star game for me.,Positive,403,81
Cyra cupcake,2020-10-15 13:15:47,I really like the game so I totally suggest playing it. On mobile is a different story. It runs ok but I unless tou have a newer phone that can run these kinds of games you have to make sure all your other apps are closed and graphics are all on low. Even then it's not that great. It's definitely good enough though if you really have to play it on mobile. Oh and be prepared for it to take up a whole 7 gbs,Positive,408,85
Khant Sithu,2020-09-29 19:01:28,For now 4 stars from me. I'm experiencing an audio problem in-game. It is not a very big deal and i can play without audio but I want to enjoy the game to its fullest. The audio sounds like it's having a bad latency and sometimes distorted. I'm not experiencing graphics problems FYI and the problem lies with AUDIO ONLY. Please fix this problem as I want to give this game a full star. Btw I'm playing with Razer Phone 1.,Positive,422,81
Marble Soda,2020-10-13 17:34:17,"The only problem I have is that if you the male protagonist they keep saying that your the female protagonist and refer to your sibling as he and you as she (even though your male) here's a quote Venti: ""the abyss order hasn't rallied behind a leader before, so sadly I can't tell you anything about this abyss prince (I'm the male protagonist so he was supposed to say princess and it's written as princess) sorry about that...""

Dan Yel,2020-10-08 23:35:46,I've had lots of fun playing this game. It's a very great game and I know this game will be more than successful in the future but please make it mobile friendly it eats up the cpu I had to put it on the lowest setting but still goes up to 95 to a 100% cpu usage my phone gets very hot when I play and it makes it very laggy but even though its like that I know it's an early released game I will still be playing this I'm looking forward for the next update tho theres plenty of room for improvement,Positive,500,104
Seo Soojin- San,2020-09-29 12:35:12,"downloading the extra resources from the game is slow but i get that i have patience to wait, but in the game it only gets worse, its so laggy at the point that i can't even play the game. i love the game so much, but please fix this soon, im so hyped when it release. that's just disappointing that I can't even play the game nicely because it's so laggy",Positive,355,71
Bradley Wynne,2020-10-10 15:16:17,"It's an amazing game that could of been so much more if it had more. Once you're like finally I'm rank 30, reality sets in and you realize there isnt much to look forward to. The map is fully explored, you have no more story quests, and there is this since of pointlessness at that point. Sure, you got abyss domain to complete but that simply isnt enough to motivate me to keep playing. Yay, one story quest every 2 ranks after 30 until those four are done too. Need live ingame events and a 2nd map",Positive,500,97
Dux Denver Fabiolas,2020-10-01 07:02:33,"I love this game!!! It's great but the reason why I gave it a 4 star is beacuase of 2 reasons 1. It takes up to much space, it makes the game laggy and sometimes 2. it kicks me out for no reason at all at random pls fix it And also don't make the game like you need in app purchases because some of the games I like turn into those pls don't do that, I still really like the game tho!!!",Positive,386,83
Samuel Cham,2020-09-29 11:35:34,"Great game, but needs optimization. A great game to play, but the game will lag and render a lot slower when your entering an instance with a lot of buildings, objects or details. Perhaps its a server issue, perhaps its my S9 unable to run it properly. Needs an optimization for frame rates and lags. Other than that its a 5/5",Positive,326,61

The only problem I had is the time I want log in to the game, it will taking so long time to enter the game.

Michael Olphie,2020-09-30 22:02:51,"This anime-styled game features gameplay and features that feel like Breath of the Wild. This is a very similar game, but with its own world and story. Open world games all have started to feel so similar, but the differences present in Genshin Impact feel nice. The company has been very generous with rewards for the launch of the game and earning gacha rolls has been easy. The game doesn't feel lacking simply because I don't have the strongest characters. A good game that deserv s a true review",Positive,500,89
Andrew Ang,2020-10-10 15:44:20,"A solid adventure rpg. The ""wish"" for new char & weapons feels unnecessary since the game leans more towards solo play. Not a 5* for these experiences .. Lack of customization in the game no personal charm to feel special with any of the characters, including yourself. The world is big & lots of grinding.. but since its just you, it feels lonely, empty. Hell, I'd forget the protagonist's goal from time to time. Overall though, give the game a try if you're looking for a solo adventure.",Positive,490,88
Francesco Felici,2020-10-16 00:09:25,"Great game, plays like a mmorpg if it were solo, but in the best way. Faster adventure leveling would be helpful because getting to level 20 was extremely quick, and left me want to ascend, but unable to. It felt like the game was forcing me to explore in artificial way instead of an organic one. Still would recommend 4 out 5 stars. Keep up the good work.",Positive,357,68
Likhit Chikine,2020-09-28 12:35:56,"The game is awesome and looks visually stunning for a mobile game but can you just please optimise the game better as I am getting frame drops even on lower graphic settings and can you please add an anti aliasing switch in the graphics menu, please? Those are my only two wants from the game and if you listen to it, it is an automatic 5 star for me.",Positive,351,69
Stomper Stompersson,2020-10-13 15:48:59,"Update after some more time playing it. Graphics, gameplay and story are still great, but the big problem is the stamina system (resin). In half an hour you'll have done everything you can do and drained your stamina, and there's nothing really to do while it regens - one point every 8 minutes and you'll need 20 at a minimum so 2.5 hours wait to run a dungeon or ley line. 7.5 hours wait to run a boss. So far I'm still enjoying roaming and seeing the sights while waiting, but that'll fade.",Positive,493,93
Chad Krell,2020-10-02 00:08:30,"Game play feels very familiar if you have played zelda:botw, but by no means are these the same. I would give 5 stars for sure if the cinematics didn't freeze up, but at least it still moves onto the game after the cinematics allotted length. Also climbing is a bit off at times. It will refuse to climb some objects or places unless my camera is perfectly aligned with it, then at other times I'm climbing a wall before I knew it and lost what I was chasing around the corner. Still an awesome game!",Positive,500,95
Eli Moshe,2020-09-29 20:36:42,"I really enjoyed the game, it gave me a kind of BoTW feeling yet it felt so unique and interesting at the same time, one thing that ruined it for me though that made me lower one star, you cannot pet the dog at Mondstadt.

Dominic giampola,2020-10-03 13:16:41,"Pretty fun game, real fun exploring and gliding everywhere. Combat isn't the best, but still solid. Graphics are gorgeous, but it's a phone heater. I'd probably give it 5*s but the gacha is terribly feelsbadman, so be prepared to get a whole lotta nothing. The free characters you get are fun and more than usuable, but if we are being real everyone wants the shiny 5*s. In conclusion it's a very good game. I'd definitely recommend a try.",Positive,439,78
Reizie Lionheart,2020-10-05 23:19:25,It's a great game you have a lot to discover and it's fun to explore the vast map but my main concern is that it often lags and hangs and it's so frustrating when it happens especially when I'm on a mission or getting ley line deposits or even just exploring itself even though my settings are all on low please fix this problem it would really help a lot of players who have the same problem as i do,Positive,400,80
TheGoldenRogue,2020-09-30 08:57:57,"Let's get this off first. It's a clone of breath of the wild. But it brings a lot of potential regardless. The story and combat are really good. But being a fan of co-op in games I gotta say it's lacking. With all the limitations they put on co-op (can't get chests, do abyss with friends, can't share quests, can't share map data, can't share loot, main story is disabled, and so much more is disabled) it makes it have no point in the multiplayer. Great game for solo but co-op is right now bad",Positive,496,95

I don't recommend if your playing on your phone your battery will drop rapidly but the game isn't bad at all. Every character is handed to you. So they automatically get at least 3 stars from me. The fourth came from game play and dialog, but not a 5 star game like you see it in the ratings. Its nt the kind of game I was expecting with all the advertisments I've seen but This is just my honest opinion.",Positive,468,93
Name 1ess,2020-10-06 15:39:00,"The game is amazing to play. The open world is breath taking and the combat is immersive. I do have a few pet peeves with the game tho: - the weapon options are fairly limited for early game play outside of gacha. - lack of a completion percentage for regions in the world map makes it very hard to find the last few remaining chests and oculi. Granted the game is still very young so I'll be patient. These are just my thoughts, still like the game and am looking forward to seeing future updates.",Positive,498,95

Pull rates are abysmal, let alone trying to get dups to max out who you do have. They also mixed weapons with characters which can make things even more frustrating if you manage to pull a 5* since it could be a weapon instead of a character depending on the banner you pull on. If they made the gacha system more bearable, I would give this 5",Positive,496,96

Aidan-Ross Adams,2020-10-09 01:13:25,"I absolutely love this game. The graphics are great, even on low. I am playing on a Huawei P20 Pro, which isn't super powerful, but should still be able to run this game at a smoother pace even on its lowest. The chipset of my phone is higher than the recommended specs which is snapdragon 845 or kirin 810, which I find very weird. Would also love if you added Gamepad and controller support.

I havent played too far into it but you're not forced to pay money to progress via payment walls, microtransactions are an optional part of the game as they should be. I will most likely however spend money on the game to support the creators. One criticism I have is that there should be Oceanic servers. I'm playing on the American server with an average of 320ms and its quite noticeable.",Positive,483,88

Seven choi,2020-10-14 13:21:40,It is a great game so far! Maybe a bit of tweaking when it comes to co-op it would be nice if we could both get an equal share when we defeat enemies or win chests.

Jolly Panda M.,2020-10-01 08:26:39,"This game is incredibly beautiful! It is easily an addicting game with storytelling, quests, foraging, cooking, leveling up of characters and weapons... In my opinion, this game is like an anime adaption of Breathe of the Wild and Skyrim rolled into one. My only issue is the controller circle.

That said this is also NOT a breath of the wild clone, it has its own unique gameplay and item mechanics.

Joshua Easton,2020-10-02 14:21:59,This game is absolutely amazing! My only complaint is that it will not work on a Samsung Tab A 10.1 (2019) which I run plenty of other high powered games on with no issues.

Igor Soares,2020-10-02 10:06:26,"Almost perfect in my opinion.. only setbacks being the lack of control customization/controller support, and most importantly how it heats up my device, by a lot (its a Galaxy S10, so not too low in the settings department) - to the point where I fear for the longevity of my phone if I keep playing (even though i'm doing so in the lowest settings possible for the game).

Mike Morris,2020-10-11 03:12:34,Finally a mobile ARPG that's actually fun to play! No auto combat or auto pathing & great exploration mechanics (climbing and gliding with a stamina bar). Combat is a bit shallow but the character swap mechanic adds just enough depth to keep it engaging for the 10-15 minutes at a time you'll likely be playing it. Loss of 1 star for the absolutely horrendous gacha mechanic.

The resin system prevent the playerbase from properly farming the dungeons and the exploration provide no way of getting prim if most of them were found. An increase in resi cap, or a faster resin regen or even events that help you fill that will be great. Additionally, im f2p, and the battle mission of getting 1600 resin weekly is impossible without refill, which i need to do. Hopefully next update will adress these issues",Positive,486,86

Jacob Morris,2020-09-30 01:28:10,"The phone version plays very well. Although bows are a bit difficult to use for me. Cross play and cross save across some platforms is appreciated! However, currently the PC version doesn't support Intel GPUs, so expect it to crash a lot. Download speed on PC is horrendous, pause and unpause the download to increase the speed or use a VPN. Story is interesting, and the characters are fun and colorful. I'd recommend it overall.",Positive,430,75
George Delle,2020-10-04 14:40:57,"This is one if the most visually impressive mobile games I've ever played. Its a really well put together story, and the combat is very smooth. The one thing that slightly bugs me as a Zelda fan is that this is blatantly a copy of Breath of the Wild. The game mechanics, shrines (temples), enemies, etc are basically ripped right from BOTW. What saves the game is that it's a GREAT copy. So it a doesn't bug me much because its so fun to play, and feels like playing BOTW on mobile, which is great!",Positive,498,95
Michael Tan,2020-10-10 02:13:14,Please give out more 5 star characters easily.. I don't want this game to lose its hype.. The only thing that makes game lasts is because its f2p friendly..

I hope the developers won't make the same mistakes..,Positive,365,68

The gameplay, story and graphics are great but the gacha rates are horrible. 180 pulls (between $300-400 USD) to guarantee a 5-star banner character. Yes, $300-400 USD for 1 copy of a digital item that needs several copies to reach its max potential. Give the game a try but my advice is to resist spending since the rates for getting 5-stars is horrible. You can play with the lower tier characters just fine.",Positive,495,90

I think there should be a offline mode for people who don't have the greatest internet connection at times. And I have way too many ""chickens"" as I call them. I never really use them as much only for red alerts, so can you please remove some of the health restored? Apples are handy for topping off before a fight but they can be kinda hard to find as well.

BearM07,2020-09-29 15:45:21,"Let me be frank the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I had different expectations or so to say I was hoping for an option to have on own unique charachter not an army of heroes but other than that the movement, graphics, audio and overall quality of the game are simply brilliant and with removing the auto fight/quest system I am sure it will become a top game in in genre as long as it avoids in future any P2W systems.",Positive,438,87

I can only hear what's going on, the screen freezes. The only thing I can do is wait for it to finish, but it bothers me because I want to see the whole cutscene, not just hear it.

First, there is no way to set waypoints to locations unless its an objective or mission. Second, when setting a waypoint (through map) to a place that isnt an actual mission (like ley lines) it doesn't show the way there it just highlights it on the minimap.

My one very minor complaint is I wish cutscenes and dialogue were fully skippable. Just add a lil hold-to-skip button, would be top notch. The voice acting is excellent but the story and characters are very boring and add nothing to the game. The air fights and gliding also not great.",Positive,437,79

Ryan Sefidpour,2020-10-11 10:54:09,"While this game executes the themes of other titles such as Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Nier: Automata, there are some fundamental flaws that prevent this game from truly being a masterpiece. The good news is, that these flaws are easily remediable. The bad news is, MihoYo doesn't seem intent, at the moment, on addressing said flaws. The Flaws are currently two-fold: the resin-system framework and the Gacha-system framework. While simply 'having' either of these systems isn't a fundamental issue, their execution in the context of Genshin Impact as a whole has proved itself problematic. For the Resin system: currently the regeneration rate and cost-per-run of essential events is deeply out of balance both in-context of the game and in-context of other Gacha games. Never before have I seen a stamina system so intent on barring me from playing this game. While most other Gacha games ala GBF, Fire Emblem Heroes, etc. have a 5 minute timer per point of stamina (with frequent distribution of refresh items and lower costs of entry), this game ties essential character advancement materials behind massive barriers of entry. Weekly bosses cost 60 Stamina and Daily bosses cost 40 each, and that doesn't include the 20-stamina dungeons that require dozens of repeats due to low drop rates to enter. The high costs wouldn't be jarring if the system didn't combine low-drop rates, high-material costs (and demands as you need 6-8 high level characters to tackle end game content), and numerous, rng-driven equipment systems that require luck to get what you need. Reducing costs, increasing 'recovery' time, or removing costs for certain activities would greatly improve this system. This isn't a simple mobile game with the majority of players being on PC/PS4, and convincing them to treat this a mobile game would be moot. Especially in light of the games that Genshin draws inspiration off of, it would be conflicting to base a game off of one that demands long play time but not incentivize such play with the progression system. The Gacha, on the other hand, is a far more simple problem, it has incredibly low rates split between equipment and characters. While the rate itself isn't horrible thanks to Pity counters, it isn't consistent in how it tackles content. Character banners offer a .6% chance per summon to get a 5-star character, with a 50% chance on a 90-summon pity timer to get the character advertised on the rate up. The non-rate-up 50% includes weapons. Conversely, Weapon banners offer a .7 rate for a 5-star weapon, with a 0 percent chance of getting a 5 star character. These rates are already low and are troubling considering the imbalanced treatment between these two banners. Furthermore, the rate of gain from day-to-day play is quite low once the map has been cleared out, which is about 60-80 hours worth of content. The simple six is an adjustment of rates or gain on currency, as current dailies offer a summon every 3 days (one of the lowest in the industry). Between a low gain-rate and a low % chance to get what you'd like, the summon system needs some love. TLDR: this game is absolutely amazing with a lot of potential. The 60-80 hours of smooth content are a blast, and combat is both easy to learn with a lot of room to master. The end-game content and system design, however, has been poorly balanced, but a quick fix wouldn't be beyond a reasonable effort for this company.",Positive,3434,584
Rachel Lynn,2020-10-26 01:36:16,I really love this game. My only issue is that I hate the touch screen controls. My laptop doesn't support the game so I have to play on my phone. Please add controller mapping and make controllers usable for the mobile version please.,Positive,235,43

I'll boost this to 5-Stars the moment controller support is added (who wants to use touch controls, especially when the game looks THIS good?) There's no reason not to have it since this game is also on PS4 and coming to the Nintendo Switch. Hopefulky enough people ask for controller support to make it happen sooner. Add that Controller Support! ^^",Positive,487,85

Awesome game Mihoyo and I hope you guys continue in this more solo friendly direction. I'm only docking a point for the extremely low gacha character rate. Pretty f2p friendly so far (I am about 20 hours in). Haven't faced any situation where a gacha character is a must have as all free characters satisfies the requirements so far.

It simply pans way too much down while I'm in a middle of a fight, to the point where my whole screen is blocked by the tall grass and I have no idea what I'm hitting or where I'm aiming.

The only thing that keeps this game from being 5 stars is the extremely predatory gacha system and constellation system. I get that they need to make money, but the idea of locking a character behind a .6% gacha pull rate is mind blowing.

Sayan BH,2020-09-29 16:33:28,Have been playing for 2 days now. As far as story and adventuring goes the game is really good. But I also expected this game to be an mmo. Where as I don't see any players. Maybe not many have joined the Asian server. I would like to have a PvP and party system with other players to go on adventure with.,Positive,306,62
Rabbit Stew4me,2020-10-17 12:09:51,"This game is absolutely amazing and I love it with all my heart and the story and I can't wait for the next update, however, at its current state, it gets very boring once you get to AR 25 because of the amount of grinding you might have to do, and I know this'll be changed once the next big update for further parts of the story comes and that there'll be more quests to level up easier. However, in it's current state, I know some people will quit until then.",Positive,462,91
Melvern Looi,2020-09-28 18:16:31,"The game is very well-made. I can tell that a lot of effort was put into it. However, every game has its flaws. For example, being a gacha game , the rates are better compared to most but still really low. For a game that does not encourage reroll, they should provide a 5* guranteed beginner gacha so players like me would feel happier playing the game. And i also have a thing against mountains. All my deaths were related to these very contraptions. Please have lesser mountains.",Positive,482,88
Tan Guan Yu,2020-10-19 21:33:25,This game is really awesome. The game has a very good quality. The only reason I'm rating this game 4 stars its because it has few lags during the cutscenes. I hope you would solve this issue. Thanks :),Positive,202,39
Daniel Hughes,2020-09-29 03:41:24,"Beautiful artwork and animation. World actually feels open unlike others that claim it. Great voice acting that shows good feeling. Not pestered by ""buy me"" ads. Reminds me of BOTW. My only complaint is not being able to link my accounts by logging in via game. I already made an account on their website. But only option in-game when linking is to create another account vs. logging into my existing account. Will be upgraded to 5 star review once resolved.",Positive,458,80
Ryan Hamilton,2020-10-13 03:36:20,"Core game mechanics are bordering on a masterpiece. The resin system + random gen stats on artifacts + dungeons with different advancement mats on different days is too many slow-down mechanics combined. Pick one. Gacha rates are also bad, but they've done a great job of making the gacha unnecessary for content completion in the long-term.",Positive,341,56
Andre Dias,2020-10-03 20:40:56,Thai has been one of the best open world rpg games I've played on my phone. Camera controls can be a little tricky with where the fight commands are but overall a game that doesn't have you aimlessly wandering around. Gacha system is pretty straight forward and fair. Honestly looking forward to playing the PC port soon and get gud,Positive,332,60
Jae Snow,2020-09-28 22:20:40,"This game is probably the best looking game for mobile devices out there, as long you are a fan of the anime aesthetic. The voice acting is well done as well. My only issue is that the bigger cinematic cutscenes will not play for me. I'll just get a frozen image over glitchy sound. Havent gotten too far in, but it's good so far.",Positive,330,64
G D,2020-10-26 16:49:36,The game is very great! It might be a gacha game but the gameplay itself is great. I just hope the resin cap improves just as the adventurer rank levels up. Same goes for the improvement in resin recharge time as a lot of f2p players really relies on this.,Positive,256,50
Jack D,2020-10-14 01:52:47,"I held off on playing this game for a while since i assumed it would be like every other hyped up anime game if this style.

Wilson Christenberry,2020-10-02 01:00:32,"Amazing, beautiful world. Tons to do great voice acting. This game is exceptional and exquisite. The ONLY reason it does not get a full 5 stars is a lack of controller support. I get having touch controls but the lack of gamepad support is baffling. Just about every single person who will play this will have a controller they can use be it an Xbox, PS4, or even some 3rd party (I use the Razer Kishi). PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ADD CONTROLLER SUPPORT!",Positive,448,82
imRenz,2020-10-09 18:09:23,"So, First of all I wanna say that this game is breathtaking for how it looks and it's story aswell. There are some problems for me though. One is the story sometimes freezes(when it shows those animations)but the audio still goes on aswell as the subtitles, second is the fact that the game freezes if I'm on a call like on discord. Even with those two problems it's still actually a great game all in all.",Positive,406,76

Kheeran Williams,2020-10-07 05:29:41,"I really love what this new anime styled rpg brings to gaming, it's an interesting take on the genre and has a really good story, but my nitpick with this game is that it drops in frames and also lags in moments of play...Which I find rather weird since lower android verson can technically run this game quite smoothly.

In detail; when the game loaded on my phone, it would inform that there is a network error, and since I use my mobile data, I would know when it is working and not(all other apps including YouTube works fine). I thought the server was being maintained however, when I used a hotspot it worked fine for a while until the same problem came about.

A P,2020-10-04 02:30:59,"Overall great game, especially for an f2p game. Gacha rates are to be expected.

Roland Caliwan,2020-10-01 10:57:20,"The game is very amazing in terms of graphics and the storyline, my only problem is that the game is too heavy to run, the moment you open the game quickly eats a lot of RAM which greatly affects the gaming experience on us lower midrange device users.

Cobra34Gaming,2020-10-20 01:31:56,"Really well made for a mobile game, graphics are nice, story is entertaining, and combat is fun and simple to learn. The only thing I can say is to make the markers more visible and swimming cost less stamina or make drowning harder.",Positive,233,43
Nilanjan Dutta,2020-09-28 23:30:14,Probably the best game I have played on a phone. No amount of praise is enough for the developers.

I both play this on pc and phone, although I'd say that the pc version is easier to maneuver. The story, art and music is great. I love the characters and even the NPC's are detailed. I'd end up playing this game for hours nonstop, since there is just too much to do in this game. I do hope that resin will regen faster. Overall, I'd give this game 4.5/5!",Positive,450,86
Madison Prendes,2020-10-06 03:32:08,"So far I am loving this game. It is phenomenal and beautiful. I do wish that they had controller support though.

V S,2020-10-03 10:25:30,"Graphics are nice and gameplay is expansive. But the most laggy mobile MMO I've played. Why does Mint always lag on pickup. Also the game doesn't make it clear how long it takes to unlock coop, or what the perks are besides a few achieves. Game focuses on the community aspect through social media, probably to make up for the complete lack of community in game. Not being able to customize even the main character in any way also bothered me more than expected. This isn't Legend of Zelda.",Positive,490,89

Leo n,2020-10-07 12:56:14,"The game is freemium, but definitely not pay to win. It must remain that way. My only issue is that characters you interact with and allegedly go adventuring with don't appear at all during the gameplay in many instances if you don't unlock them permanently. You just don't get the right feeling doing quests, because the key characters aren't there. Devs, you need to include them as playable characters in more main quests or just make it so they fight alongside you to make story more immersive.",Positive,498,87

If You really like Honkai Impact 3rd with a hint of Gameplay Elements from Games such as Spellbreak & Word of Warcraft it can be very, very fulfilling. My only issue with the Game however is that it's so Phone RAM heavy that any time You enter a cutscene it tends to lag very hard and freeze the cutscene here & there. Other than that I have no other concerns.",Positive,431,83
Rizal Naim,2020-09-28 18:00:34,"If you've played Breath of the Wild on the Switch, this game borrows no small amount from its competitor -or should I say, predecessor. Gameplay feels very much alike, this one being free. You have access to multiple chars each with their own strengths and weaknesses, you are exposed to MORE elements to use than in BoTW. You are VERY much encouraged to swap out between chars to utilize the plethora of interactions between elements - exciting. Despite being akin to BoTW, it is it's own game.",Positive,495,87
Jane Triffen,2020-09-29 02:17:00,"Played for what I can without being able to see much and or being blinded. Downloaded in a hour and half and thought it would be enjoyable... it was, for what I could see. Textures were loading away from the characters view , and what you could see near you was very bright neon green ground. I meet minimum and get at least 15 high intense areas-30 fps low .although I could not see directly I could look slightly up with camera and be able to see the land for what it really was. Good game though.",Positive,499,97
David Curtis,2020-10-04 19:08:18,This game is so much fun!! I do however HATE the artifact setup. It definitely needs to be fixed. Sorting doesn't do anything. Must be a bug.

Dan D&G,2020-10-02 02:49:05,"It's a rally good game, good game play, great graphics, but the only problem, the game it's not compatible with external joystick for me that is a big problem, because the touch controller are not really comfortable, if you make compatible the game with external joystick the game will be 5 stars.",Positive,297,52

Everything about this is perfect, the graphics, gameplay are all spot on I gave it only 4* because the gacha rates are terribly low, even more than other games of this genre.

Eroc Gittens,2020-10-17 07:37:06,"Its actually a pretty fun game. Especially if you wanna kill time. The directional controls are kinda funky, but you get a lot of cool moves and combos. This game plays like something for the switch and the graphics are awesome. My buddy could hardly believe this game was on my phone lol",Positive,288,53
na jaemin,2020-10-26 23:16:36,"Great game, fantastic game play but there is a gacha system so get your card ready lol or you can grind for free wishes ^^ would recommend but as it is still in development I would ask new players to be patient as they are updating the game so new content would be available.",Positive,275,54
Alejandro Chaves,2020-09-29 04:22:01,"This game is absolutely fantastic, the mechanics, animations and graphics are the best I have ever seen on mobile, but sadly the game is poorly optimized for low, medium and even high end devices (I have a Galaxy S10 but can only run the game at medium graphics and like 20-30 fps). I will give it a 5 star when the developers are truly optimizing the game for everyone (for example, PUBG Mobile, at the same medium graphics on the biggest map, runs perfectly on my device).",Positive,474,87
Ella Twadell,2020-10-08 00:55:42,"I love this game so much the graphics and gameplay are amazing, but there Is one thing I don't like. You can heal the characters that are dead, but you can heal them all the way and that's really annoying because I need Kaeya for a Misson but I cant use him, otherwise the game is great!",Positive,287,57
Goat Œ©,2020-10-06 04:13:55,"Great game, found no bugs since I started play it, it offers a great experience for every player even if they don't like gacha since at the start you can get a lot of characters, the only thing I would like to be added is control support. If they do that I'll give five stars.",Positive,276,55
Daniella Daisy,2020-10-13 19:14:08,"The game overall is good totally recommend it but when im playing it sometimes it keep crashing like it shows black screen while the sounds still played but it sound so creepy even tho I already open it many times,it still the same ....the reason i gave it 4 stars because it keeps lagging or crashing ......... I hope you can fix this issue asap I've taking a liking to this game but when it becomes like this idk if i can keep playing this game Hope you fix this",Positive,464,90
Misha Gaming,2020-10-15 11:27:45,"Experience is really amazing. Rating 4 star because of the limited coop gamplay. If the devs would expand the quests/gamplay in coop then I think I'll see the game go into a good direction. Overall an excellent game to play single player. Coop though it is amazing, has still more potential! Will rate 5 once coop has been improved",Positive,331,59
Ying Lim,2020-10-27 22:41:49,"Great game, love the graphics and storyline. The only problem I have is that the game heat up my phone too fast, not sure if is due to the graphic quality but it will be good if it fix the issue.",Positive,195,41
Prithviraj Singh Tomar,2020-10-06 13:43:19,"Awesome , great detailing and perfect game but just try to add step by step navigation for next main mission after completing a main mission, and fix the joystick run in little moment also the player starts running instead of walking hard to pose the player at small surfaces , too much battery consumption and heating problem and try to make it bit more smooth on Redmi note 8 pro.",Positive,382,70
Ëä¶Áî∞ÂíåÈÉéderpy,2020-10-21 22:00:09,"It's great. Really great, although the reason for the 4 star rate is I found a bug whenever I'm reconnecting. The screen keeps glitching when it's reconnecting, I think this needs attention. But overall rate, very great game.",Positive,225,38
Aaliyah D,2020-09-30 05:17:56,So far this game is great. The graphics are really nice and the story is pretty cool. My only complaint is the walking controls sometimes make me go the wrong way which is a little annoying but thats the downside of playing on mobile i suppose. I reallg love all the voices too.,Positive,278,53
DOO DOO THE DOO,2020-10-08 16:42:11,"the game got similar vibes with BOTW,, MASSIVE OPEN WORLD MAP with so many hidden mission and story,, but my problem is the first time i play the game, they recommend me AMERICA server, but currently im in southeast asia,, already spend like a week, then when the COOP open, my ping just too high, and if i change server i have to startover . is there anyway to move my acc to asia server?",Positive,389,75
Human,2020-09-29 02:59:54,"This is a lainch day,so things might change.I love this game.Performance,graphics,controls,music,gameplay,story,voiceacting and so much more.The only problem is performance with cutscenes because it freezes and glitches.And it is sad that Playstation players can't link tgeir accounts.Other than that mg favourite mobile(maybe also rpg)game currently!!!",Positive,353,44
Matthew Frelinger,2020-10-07 12:32:57,"Surprisingly charming so far, and the combat feels natural. Would give it a higher rating, but the Android app has an audio bug - crackling begins after 15+ minutes of play, and gets gradually worse. Restarting the app fixes the issue for the next 15 minutes. I look forward to trying it on PC!",Positive,294,54
Kwaku Poku,2020-10-06 11:06:26,"God damn is this a fun game. I knew nothing about it prior to it's release and downloaded it on a whim, but man have I been enjoying every second of it. Even though it has gatcha I'm sure you can play this game as a f2p. There are the occasional issues here and there but all in all a fantastic game.",Positive,300,62
Melvin Honorio,2020-10-25 16:28:37,This game has a lot of potential... But there resin system or stamina system is much worse than epic 7... so little much to farm when your on lvl 30 and up... Cant upgrade much for your heroes because of the stamina... But still a good game but needs improvement...,Positive,265,50
PrincessKatsume,2020-10-03 08:11:20,"Great game with lots of great things,but 2 flaws that shouldn't be a thing, the game story doesn't register which main character u chose so they are always called the wrong gender,and u have no way of playing with people in other parts of the world as if u try to connect to a different server all progress is lost",Positive,314,60
joseph goh,2020-09-27 21:30:52,"Everything is fine in my opinion for now. Except co-op, i really hope the developers of this game can implement cross server co-op so that we can play with friends no matter what server they started with. On this day, co-op only can take place within a server. If friends from other servers like Asia wants to join you in your island in the America server, they wont be able to join since its different servers. I hope they can implement cross server co-op soon",Positive,461,85
sharat kumar,2020-10-06 22:19:36,"Really really fun game to play if you for mind the gacha system. There is always something to do be it story or co up. My only issue is audio gets really bad after few minutes into the game, it adds some static noise which imo distractes a lot. So for now I am reducing one start for it. Hope you can fix it in 1.1 :)",Positive,317,67
wzen,2020-10-04 04:50:02,"great game but what's up with the statue worshipping? kinda disrespectful to other religions so if you'd be so kind to remove or at least make a way for us to just skip this one, it would be awesome. Since I've been stuck in level 9 with a few ways to get little chara EXP lol. plus it takes LOTS of battery energy my phone dies triple the speed so if there's a way to fix this, too, we would really appreciate it. please consider this, thank you!",Positive,447,88
Caitlin Keely,2020-09-30 01:40:16,"I love everything about this game it's not the same cheesy generic anime rpgs I've played it's actually really good. But the joystick needs a sensitivity slider I'm flying all over the place just trying to walk in the right direction. Otherwise beautiful game, no ads, I even love the little sidekick fairy.",Positive,307,53
Maximilian Birkhorst,2020-10-10 01:35:31,"I like the Gameplay and Art of the Game a lot, i played for a few hours now and it still amazes me gameplay-wise however, for a gacha, the rates are ridiculous 0.6% and a pity counter at 90 pulls, which is basically a 100 bucks by-the-by, doesnt help at all...all in all the game is good, rates arent.",Positive,301,59
Mark Anthony Santos,2020-10-03 22:17:42,"A bit of disappointing, it take so much time before the game start, not optimised for mid to low end devices. Same with PC version. If the devs can make it a little friendly please, my device is always hot when playing, you can feel it with your hands. But at the other side, Game graphics and story line was very good.",Positive,319,62

Chris Gonzales,2020-10-13 12:59:59,"The game is good but really needs a little more optimization of the game for low end devices so people with low end devices can enjoy a non-pixelated and non-laggy game just as people with high end devices are experiencing right now. To think majority of the players from mobile devices are using low end device so it would be great if they are prioritize as well to make the game even cooler for them as well, too. :)",Positive,418,79

I've been waiting for this for so long it's great but, there's a slight problem I don't know if it's just for me but sometimes the server would just go out then come back in if that makes sense?

Abhishek Biswas,2020-10-03 00:00:32,"By far, played one day, this is the best Isekai(maybe) RPG type of game with brilliant graphics. Everything is beautiful, the landscapes are stunning & the battles are cool. Only problem is battery and graphics optimization which is/are a load on many phones. I am playing on RN7pro with SD675 on low settings 30 fps, still experiencing decent lag but much battery consumption. If all things are fixed it would be one hell of a game",Positive,432,76

Also it doesn't fills as a Pay to Win game",Positive,293,58
Sosaia Mataele,2020-10-03 12:39:19,"Honestly it's a great game. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking and the music is amazing, but I don't like how much gigabytes it takes for a mobile game. It is a really cool game that the developers probably worked hard on and I would completely recommend this game to all my friends.",Positive,289,52
Steven Whitney,2020-10-14 10:27:28,"Amazing gameplay but extremely anti-consumer microtransactions. The cost of being able to roll the dice on getting a hero you want is insanely high. It will cost hundreds of dollars just to get a hero you want, with duplicates not offering anything of equal value. Play the game for story/gameplay, not for the gambling. Would be a 5 star title of there wasn't gambling and absurd prices.",Positive,388,67
Denis Petrov,2020-10-17 02:34:52,"An amazing game, graphics, story, characters. There's only one problem - the password field is text type and saves your password as a used word on your keyboard, which is not cool. Will give 5 stars when fixed, because I can't play it on mobile because of this.",Positive,261,48
christian reyes,2020-09-28 21:49:22,"Beautiful game but touch issues on display, it really reminds me of BOTW Zelda which is why I love it.. very impressive for a mobile game the only issue I am starting to notice is that during dialogs or selecting certain items the touch doesn't seem to want to register within the first couple if taps and I know for a fact there is nothing wrong with my display. Hopefully that gets looked at. Once that is fixed then this game is definitely worth 5 stars!",Positive,457,86
Dire wolf official,2020-10-15 16:31:30,This game is amazing ..it has a very good environment....the hereos are very cool too The only thing that we all want in this game is (multiplayer story mode) We all wanted to play story mode with friends or friend I hope in near future we'll get this feature to play story mode with friends And the data of the game is almost 7gb Would've been sooomuch cool if there was Multiplayer story mode,Positive,394,74
Muhammad Fariz Lazuardi,2020-10-02 17:58:41,"Gameplay is good, graphics are remarkable. One thing what I would like to be added in this game is controller support.

Daijoubu Gaming,2020-10-03 10:56:34,"Its a very fun game. It has my favorite factors in it from Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild but this game has a different taste to it and I like that taste.

dotonBuri,2020-09-28 20:49:31,"Everything is about right for my passing grade phone, a little problem would be that the cutscenes sometimes or mostly lag, a bit of troublesome because I'd have to wait long 'til it finishes or I'd have to restart the app, that would be a bad experience when playing with my friends since id have to restart, aside that I still enjoy playing the game, if you could fix the problem that would be great",Positive,401,75
Tim Velighzanin,2020-10-08 00:54:10,The gameplay and game itself is second to none. Its soo much fun to play and grind.

Fire Breathing Chicken Duck,2020-10-10 03:38:17,Love it! I have a problem with the audio glitching and getting stuck.

Kayo Yuuki,2020-09-28 13:09:52,"Beautiful refreshing game taking the right step to change the mobile platform for the better.

Zach Parent,2020-10-02 06:18:59,"Great, with one caveat.

Jada Huntley,2020-09-28 10:50:12,"I really like this game it seems really fun. It is just that it is really slow for me, when it goes to story time. I give this game a 3 and a half rating only because I dont barely know that much about it yet all I know is it is pretty good so far other than the slowness.",Positive,272,60
Kyaseng Lozam,2020-10-11 23:07:07,"Really an amazing game. This particular game genre was only limited to pc before but now its in mobile too. But i give it a 4 star only coz of very low optimization for android systems could be better, gets very laggy at some point but overall its pretty good. Hope the devs optimizes the graphics with the upcoming updates.",Positive,324,60
Jesse Smallpiece,2020-09-30 07:19:18,"I've been having a blast playing this, most I've been engaged in a mobile game in a while.

RnD Official,2020-10-23 16:07:59,"Overall its wonderful and insteresting.I just got a problem and hope dev team will do something about it.The original resin which we use to farm exp card,mora,artifact and prototype weapon was not good.1 resin need 10 minutes to recharge while we use 20 - 60 resin to claim reward in a dungeon/boss.It ruin the gameplay for player to keep farm.I suggest either dev team lower the recharge time or add more resin in the game.Please put the fragile resin in the shop too so we can redeem use stardust.",Positive,499,89
Nou Xiong,2020-10-02 22:20:22,"Pretty awesome game. Never thought cell phone could compete against console games but this game guest blows it away.

Tana Bailey,2020-09-28 13:09:19,"I want to give this game 5 stars. I have waited a long time for it and I'll continue to play it until I've burnt myself out. The reason I havent given it 5 stars is due to no controller support on the phone. The pc allows it, as does the ps4. I understand programing and coding is a tedious job and I can only imagine the work the creators have with the games release. However, controller gaming is a big part of mobile gaming. If they ever add it ill change my review.",Positive,469,94
Sie Sie,2020-10-14 10:56:29,This game is absolutely amazing! But it would be really good to fix the lag so i can enjoy the game properly.

Will Jones,2020-10-07 08:43:39,"This game is awesome, so engrossing and well done! The only issue I have is the lack of controller support.

Florence Scroggins,2020-10-23 06:48:57,"Probably one of the best games I've played and only have one real complain: The character odds in the wish, they are extremely low and can be a huge waste of gems since you cant exactly get them easily without wasting money.",Positive,224,42

Kengy Thao,2020-10-07 02:16:12,"My experience with the game is engaging. I can spend most of my freedom exploring and looking for hidden secrets.

Chanuka Sachintha,2020-10-22 01:45:45,Game is great but it would be much fun if the co-op mode in this was like sword art online.. rather than players have their own worlds it would be better if all players in the server had one world.

Austin Huynh,2020-10-07 11:28:40,"The graphics and gameplay are great, lots to do and the characters are fun to use.

The gacha rates definitely need to be increased, and have the pity carry over between banners.",Positive,293,55
Jason Berardo,2020-10-07 21:33:09,"Great game so far. Terrific production quality, overall graphics are superb on my Oneplus 8. Being able to use the same account on my PC and phone is also awesome. The reason I'm only giving 4 stars, as others have pointed out, is the lack of controller support on Android. The onscreen controls are well implemented but being able to use a controller would make it that much better. Otherwise, highly recommended.",Positive,414,72

Mattise M,2020-09-28 19:04:48,Looks alright but movement stick is horrendous on higher aspect ratio phones which is the majority of newer phones now.

Joey Shewmaker,2020-10-19 01:58:54,Its better than most of its competition although it would be much better if the restrictions of how much you can grind. remove the capacity of resin or decreased the amount of resin dungeons and bosses to a point that it would take you all day to expend your resin.,Positive,265,50
Kaito Nakatte,2020-10-26 21:40:58,Really well designed open-world game on multiple platforms. Framerate isn't the best or comfortable to play on mobile but is still good. Definitely lack of content late game but I hope it'll change further down the road.,Positive,220,37
Martin Lomholt-Mortensen,2020-10-19 04:20:03,"Beautiful graphics and I like all the voice overs, only thing keeping it from five stars is that it does not have controller support as the phone gets very warm running it and holding the phone adds extra heat from my hands and blocks some heat dissipation",Positive,256,47
Garrett Huggins,2020-10-13 09:02:58,"I like the game alot, my only complaint is that there is no controller support on mobile.

DrakerGamer,2020-10-16 07:00:08,The graphics are amazing and i really love the mechanics to this game but the only downside I've had is that the cutscenes have been glitching and not playing properly.

Vita Korp3n,2020-10-11 06:26:25,"A lot of fun, but it lacks a lot of substance. Given time I think this game will be a 5 star game.

Please add some tameable creatures",Positive,246,45
Daniel,2020-10-04 22:47:02,"Really loving the story so far, the graphics are phenomenal.

I was expecting custom character, not premade characters. Not a deal breaker but definitely disappointing. Quest markers feel handholding, needs fixing. My main complaint is controls. On pc & on mobile, bad controller support, no controller binding, & no onscreen button placement. I HATE the positions, uncomfortable. Please let me reposition/rebind 4/5 stars",Positive,497,75

John The baptiste,2020-09-29 21:16:52,"I really enjoy this game so far, every once in a while the game will have to reconnect to the server which is a bit of an annoyance, especially when your in a battle and it randomly drops connection, also not sure if anyone else has noticed lagg, I have.",Positive,254,50
Chroma Arwin,2020-10-11 02:59:27,"The game is great the only thing holding it back is controller support for me, playing with your fingers covering the screen leaving smudges along with trying to fight while trying to turn the camera is kinda annoying, if this game could receive an update in the future to support controllers just like the PC perfect 5star",Positive,323,57
Eino Duazo,2020-10-22 22:33:31,"Have the game optimized for Android devices as well, I was playing at lowest graphics with my One Plus 5T (Snapdragon 835) and still experience hitches, frame drops. While the recommended requirements, would SD845, it's just a step higher tho.",Positive,243,40

I downloaded the app and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the game. The world is huge, the characters are well made, and the story is actually engaging. Take it from someone who never thought he would like an anime game. This game is actually really fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun game to just have some fun with. Very pleasantly surprised.",Positive,495,97
Amar Wibianto,2020-09-30 15:00:44,"Gonna give this 4 stars though I didn't play it on my phone, since it won't gonna survive the heat if I keep torture it to play beyond its limit, but I did play it on my PC. So far the game is good and fun, and this game is free anyway so I can't really complain much about this game, as long as the devs keep adding more and more content in the game I'm sure this game might be last longer. The one that I can suggest maybe add some more multiplayer content in it, since it's a single player game",Positive,497,103
AbSoLute ZeRoo,2020-10-05 05:37:12,"Wonderful game! Great graphics, fun story and even better gameplay!

Tom Christopher,2020-09-29 11:58:56,"The game has very good graphics but sometimes the frames drop so much when it comes to cutscenes, and the server isn't that optimized yet.

Chinyimba Mando,2020-10-02 22:39:10,"Great Game, I can't believe it's free. It honestly feels like a traditional RPG than a Gacha.

Molten,2020-09-29 10:14:38,"The game runs and looks great on my phone and I really enjoy the breath of the wild gameplay.

Austin Donyette,2020-10-15 23:05:34,"The Resin system needs and update it is really limiting, Ik that thats the idea to make us pay...

Zzain ‚Ä¢,2020-10-17 11:57:11,i really like the game and all since it's like zelda breath of the wild however can you make the multiplayer system or co-op better?. I've spent countless of hours on this game and I've recently hit a wall at the gameplay can i ask that you guys increase the resins cap as your statue level increase or something since it takes waaaay too long. If possible make another region and story or quest for ar 30+ so we can have more gameplay.,Positive,436,83
kevin L,2020-10-09 03:58:11,"Everything is good in the game but one thing I don't understand is why you only allow each character to equip only 5 artifact instead of 6, since the set bonus only happen when is a set of 2 or 4.

Aries,2020-10-15 10:18:11,"The game is almost perfect Its fun, good graphic, and addictive but the resin system needs to go.

Danial Haikal,2020-10-07 12:55:24,Please do something about the resin system. Resin is usually the only thing me and my friends do in coop. But the resis ran out after a few fight. Also make spiral abyss a coop option so we can play with our friends more. Maybe make a weekly treasure for spiral abyss for coop. This game really need more fixing on coop mode. Otherwise this game is an easy 5 star,Positive,363,71
Weebs_ Unite,2020-10-14 05:59:13,"Well honestly i enjoyed the game with the graphics and controls that is good but i had problems with the audio because it started to hurt my ear while using headphones. Somehow the audio started to seem a bit off so i was giving this a 4 star because of the audio, anyways keep up the good work",Positive,294,58
William Faust,2020-10-05 18:36:05,So one thing I would like to see improved is the climbing mechanics. So when I play this game sometimes I walk into a wall because I just suck... but then I just start randomly climbing a wall this is kinda annoying as the tutorial said to jump on a wall to climb not touch it.,Positive,277,56
James Cruz,2020-10-06 02:09:06,"Full of fun, adventures, and story. The graphics of the world, actions, and cutscenes is so great. However the chances of getting a 5 star hero is so low. I hope they will increase the chance of it. Overall the game is great.",Positive,225,43
baruc ji,2020-10-25 22:24:44,The game is amazing I'll play it on my PC and my note 20 ultra but ever since this last update I have not been able to open up the game on my phone while using cellular data but when I'm using Wi-Fi I'm able to open it.,Positive,219,48
Marco Robles,2020-10-07 00:17:47,"Game is perfect but I have a issue with the control settings ps4 and on mobile I want to customize my configuration and when I link my ps4 controller to my mobile game it usually works with other games pretty well but on this game it only uses the touch pad on my controller like a mouse and the other buttons were disabledüò† that's why I knocked out 1star ,item drops suck too but then again there's a lot you could pick up",Positive,423,83
Eyad Ragaee,2020-10-23 02:42:42,Its a good game with lots of potential but there are 4 problems 1-lags alot on mobile 2-needs to have higher unit rates in the future 3-needs to add pvp or co-op 4-the camera sometimes starts to act up and mess me up in combat Ty and i hope u fix this genshin impact u have lots of potential dont waste it,Positive,305,62
Lardzo Aximus,2020-10-10 09:51:58,"Nice Game with fantastic graphic, but the gacha rate really unforgiving and not balanced, many of my friends got a bunch of 5 stars at once on first try while the others still got junk weapons with no characther on 10th pull. But still a good game hope the developer giving a system while paid content giving a higher chance for ssr pulls",Positive,338,63
9 - Joshua,2020-10-15 02:36:36,"Resin system needs to be fixed or retuned ASAP! The lack of content-ish to do after you finished all of the main story is lackluster. Once you finished the story, you can only do 3 boses every 12hours or every day which is only 20mins in real time And add in the daily commissions! We want to grind for the talent books, ascension materials, and other materials for our characters or weapons for atleast 4 hours and not only 20mins! So increase the resin cap or lower the resin needed in dung or boss",Positive,500,94
Eric Setiawan,2020-10-12 08:48:43,"It has been amazing so far, but I'm very concerned with the end game. Most likely you will only do dailies and kill a couple of bosses every day. No daily login bonus, very low summoning rate, very low number of premium currencies for f2p. 1 SSR every 5+ months is not a good idea.",Positive,281,55
Jonathan Picker,2020-09-29 10:06:37,"A really fun game. Great action, really open world. My only complaint is that it can be incredibly frustrating to play on mobile. Accidentally pushing something you don't mean to or missing something because your finger moved barely is really annoying.",Positive,252,41
Jezuriel,2020-10-08 18:59:09,"The game is great! Yet, too much for my phone (Realme 5i). Next time, please indicate your minimum and recommend specs for this game in the description so people will know if they may or may not be able to play the game. That's all, peace out.",Positive,243,47
Gwe Deneb,2020-10-07 16:30:55,Its not bad it could me much better since this is mihoyo they do well with there games but as this is on pc and on consoles the horrendous gacha rates dont fly with anyone unless you whale. And will see alot of people drop the game with all the extra stuff you cant exactly do after awhile They striped stuff from units peicemeal that should be made basic for most units of each weapon class . Otherwise gameplay and story is well done but it needs crossserver badly,Positive,466,89
faroyzer fabian,2020-10-04 18:52:30,"Im having fun with this game a lot. The only thing that bothers me is that, this game doesn't seem to host a southeast asia server. Im stuck playing at 160-200+ ping even though im on asia server. It would be better if other servers were hosted so more people can enjoy this game.",Positive,280,54
Nizam,2020-10-04 08:38:39,"This game is like witcher 3 type but it's in anime, good for anime lovers but it's not realistic like witcher 3. Remove anine and put some humanity thing like love , lust etc .you can make better game then this if you remove anime things. Only thing is it's in android. I am shore in future pitcher 3 developers with port the game to Android",Positive,341,66
Mika Tsuki,2020-10-07 18:20:13,The game is much better than expected and beautiful as well. The only downside is that I can't use the data transfer as planned because I have a Linux system. Also the controls on mobile tend to cause some frustration when fighting bosses and other hordes.,Positive,256,46
Darkrai Union,2020-10-13 16:41:11,"I mainly play on pc, I use the mobile version for basic task. I absolutely love the game, but its hard to grind out and play as much as I want to. Due to the resin system in the game. I would highly recommend playing, and enjoy every second of the story quest!",Positive,260,53
Ren,2020-10-04 07:04:15,Literally everything is amazing in this game but the rates for the gacha. 380 pulls and I've only gotten guaranteed 4 stars per 10 pull and guaranteed 5 stars per 90 pulls. The rate for a 5 star is 0.6%. The rate for a 4 star is like 5%. Its really bad. But seriously everything else is amazing.,Positive,295,58
Kenny Ford,2020-11-02 07:21:29,"All it needs is character customization and it's perfect,in my opinion",Positive,70,11
Renz Intino,2020-11-03 14:14:23,This games really great i would rate it a 5 star sadly whenever theres a scene the Voicelines keep glitching.,Positive,109,20

VISHAL SHUKLA,2020-11-10 18:20:11,Love it game is great but....there have a problem they have some lags and bugs.....,Positive,83,15
Pratik Gharat,2020-11-15 01:38:40,Game is very nice but sometime lag i think because of low ram . A nice story.,Positive,77,17
Jean-Claude McKay,2020-10-15 02:30:05,"Excellent Game, gameplay and graphics are out of this world. Only thing it lacks is controller support then it would be perfect, hence the 4 stars. I look forward to future updates, hopefully we get mount and housing systems in future.",Positive,235,41
Sebastian Casillas,2020-10-03 19:05:32,"Really good game, to bad it designed as a free to play, pay to win game instead of a full game for a price. If they ever develop a full game where I am not afraid of needing to spend more money to keep progressing I'll buy the hell out of it.",Positive,242,52
Arnav K,2020-10-06 13:08:24,"The opening scene doesn't play properly, keeps lagging, it's annoying. Although the rest of the game, apart from cut scenes, is amazing. Truly one of a kind, it's impressive how this game is so detailed and yet is available for free.",Positive,233,41
Eugen,2020-10-09 17:12:17,Cant give full 5 star as getting a 5 star is a very bad experience for me iam soon to be rank 32 and have not seen a single 5 star unit nor weapon despite putting a lot of effort into farming primo gems and quests and summoning. Even more frustrating is when your friends pull several 5 stars just like that keeps me away from spending money,Positive,341,68
Sammy Blitz,2020-10-04 17:21:28,"Best game of 2020! But the reason I rated this as 4 ‚≠ê is because I can't use my Bluetooth Mi Airdots or regular headset. I can't hear any music or sounds, but when I use different apps such as youtube and etc. I can hear sounds normally. Please FIX THE BLUETOOTH AND HEADSET settings for Mi 9T Pro thanks!",Positive,305,60
sadboy Sam,2020-10-05 22:11:59,"Extremely good game, lots to explore,lots of secrets to find, lots of quests and it's a lot of fun but the rates for the 5 stars are ridiculous and the amount of primogems you need to summon and the number you get at a time are not very balanced, but fantastic game otherwise",Positive,275,53
Philip Mazur,2020-10-06 10:28:31,The game is really great and runs smoothly in my case. It feels a bit like breath of the wild but has completely different game mechanics. My only qualm is that the cut scenes lag and stutter some of the time and makes me wish for a buffer system.,Positive,247,49
Khahlil Gibran,2020-09-29 21:20:10,"It's a great game overall, but can you add a gamepad feature? I'd like to play this game on my gamepad. And one more thing is, why we can't interact with the animal like cats and dogs in the town? Can you add that feature too? Thank you for making such a great game :)",Positive,268,55
Pranav Sarda,2020-10-24 20:48:13,Its a very very good game but there is bug or an issue just for me that i lose 10 primogems without actually spending them..plus there is lot of bugs in the game i get that its new but it needs to be fixed or else at least give compensation,Positive,240,50
Phillip DeJong,2020-10-28 12:09:24,I am enjoying this game so far and only have come across one thing I wish was part of the game. I wish the game had controller support so you wouldn't have to deal with the drawbacks of mobile gaming for as long.,Positive,212,43
Lawrence Antipala,2020-10-03 15:16:24,"Great game, despite using some ideas of other games and mashed it together into one. The only problem is the coop, what's the point of having coop if we have little thing to do? We can't even go inside temples and open some chests or even talk to NPCs, pls fix the coop.",Positive,270,53
Rikku Kirru,2020-10-22 09:06:00,"The visuals are good, the combat is enjoyable, the audio is ok, music is almost non existent, there's a fair amount of grinding you need to do to unlock the rest of the game.",Positive,174,34
CyClone Grove,2020-10-03 12:11:01,"Everything in this game is perfectly fine, except for one thing, the co-op mode, wish there's not many restrictions in it. There's not much to do in co-op mode when you're out of resin, other than fighting normal mobs in ur friend's world.",Positive,239,43
Anthony,2020-10-06 09:12:19,I really am having fun with the game but there are a few things that could be better. I don't like how you can buy gems to buy loot crates. Please change this! Also please add more weapons into the game. I've already seen most of the weapons. I really like the game though.,Positive,273,54
Jude Jayawardana,2020-10-13 14:08:39,Playing On My S8plus Low 60fps(High Also Working ).Gorgeous Graphics and a Huge Applause For the Devs...But There Itsy Bitsy Things Missing. It would be great if the controls could get an update and the game needs a little more optimization. And Some Times the cutscenes stutters a little bit. But Overall it's great game.,Positive,322,55
__________ Cypher,2020-10-29 00:02:52,"Amazing game but please make it be able to run better on lower end devices. What I mean are the cutscenes and gameplay, it always causes image freeze and shuts down the game in a few minutes from starting.",Positive,205,39
Keith Patrick Bugayong,2020-10-05 07:52:15,"This is one of the most enjoyable games I've come across. Story so far is great, the world is huge, and the characters look amazing. I do wish there is controller support, as well as emulator support and optimizations for lower end devices.",Positive,240,43
Bobgames2017,2020-09-29 09:34:15,It's a really fun game. love the open world because im a sucker for open world game. The combat is cool and the story idk right now it is interesting and it is good right now. The only downside is the big dowload I don't like big downloads but overal a good gacha game in my opinion.,Positive,283,57
Jerry Bennett,2020-10-11 11:44:18,"Great game, the fact its cross platform is really nice. Only flaw i can see at the moment is there doesnt seem to be support for Bluetooth controllers. Would absolutely love for that to be implemented. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars :)",Positive,239,44
TheUnrealisticMan,2020-10-17 09:40:31,"Love this game so much, the story, the graphics is just amazing. But I'll love this game more if the settings were added more like gyro sensitivity or like control settings. Also i kinda dislike the resin system because it generate to slow and the dungeons are to expensive to use the resin.",Positive,291,53
sweet√∏creature,2020-10-17 12:21:46,"Overall game is Awesome, no doubt about it but co op lack something which makes it boring after like playing ot for 1-2 hr.. apart from that ive issue with GYROSCOPE idk its device problem or game's .. In my device i can play on 60fps without lag but GYROSCOPE sucks hell lot of delay ..and sometimes time there's sudden chg in Day-Night Cycle, like when im in fight suddenly it gets night and day or vice versa",Positive,411,78
Bao Mai,2020-10-07 04:06:47,"A quite unique game that's very refreshing to play, with very beautiful graphics. What i have to complain however, is the lack of control layout customization, as some of the buttons placement can be confusing to use if you are used to other games control.",Positive,256,45
phoenix down,2020-10-22 22:13:58,I have to say that I am verry impressed with the android version of this game the graphics and story so far are really good BUT I feel that I can't keep playing on because of the lack of controller support please could you implement this feature it is verry awkward to play as it is,Positive,282,56
Michael Ronquillo,2020-09-30 22:38:25,"This game is definetely a must try and packed full of content, it is definetely eye dropping. Only thing I can recommend for the developers is allow us to connect a Bluetooth controller, any controller not just ps4 and use while playing this on mobile. Hands get cramped after playing for a while..",Positive,298,53
Jeeying Chan,2020-10-15 00:50:40,"It's a really fun game and has plenty of rewards to give inside. But when you exit the game for a few minutes, it resets the game again and it sometime glitches and won't change the character until a few minutes later. Overall, the game is great and fun!",Positive,254,49
alasdair boyd,2020-10-04 22:39:06,"This Is a pretty decent game, only thing is, Just like in BOTW, the enemies are lacking, some recoloured goblins, slimes. Makes the game get boring much faster, hope you add a wider enemie base and not just recolours. Its already better than BOTW but dang you could make it a million times better with more selection",Positive,316,57
CGDavis,2020-09-27 23:37:13,"Imagine being so stupid that you leave a 1 star review because you get an error when the games servers aren't up yet. Learn to read people. This game is fantastic. It isn't perfect, but it's really good. You'll definitely spend a ton of time on this game. It has great combat, exploration, characters, and a solid story.",Positive,320,58
Michaella Barnum,2020-10-20 00:09:06,Wonderful game with a rich world and decent storyline and supporting characters. My issue is that it crashes a lot. I will place everything on the lowest possible graphic setting and it will still crash.,Positive,203,35
The Jeff,2020-10-27 00:33:55,The graphics is really good and the gameplay is excellent. Maybe it will be much better if are mini games that dont require a lot of resin so you can keep playing for much longer.,Positive,179,35
Ethan Sosa,2020-10-09 06:38:12,I really enjoy how this game is open world and you have to level up and its just what I was looking for when I play a game. The only thing that I don't like is how expensive it is to summon for a new character or weapon. I just wish it's a little more fair for us f2p,Positive,267,59
Nightcore Dive,2020-10-18 13:04:57,The requirement of downloading additional 5GB+ data is little frustrating and i don't think everyone can do that. It should be in chunks like downloading data as story progresses more and more rather than downloading whole data in the starting.,Positive,244,40
HakataTonkotsuRamen,2020-10-06 09:15:09,"Absolutly shamless BOTW clone. The rating I gave is for the game they ripped off of called The legend of zelda: Breath of the wild. While it is not a 100% clone the similarities and in game animation is extremely alike to BOTW. And while cloning a game is common in the industry, the problem is mihoyo's attitude towards it. They clone it and then call it as ""paying respects to the tittle and its dev"". Thats just shameless and disgusting.",Positive,440,81
N Mabini,2020-10-05 08:11:48,Everything is nicely done and is fun to play! My only problem is the character's eyes. When I first started playing they were fine but now they look lifeless their expression does not change when they do idle things. I hope they fix this.,Positive,238,44
Winter A. R Brown,2020-09-28 12:56:58,The 2 things can see that could be better for now is the guard breaking system (wish the monster bubble shields could be broken with enough force cuz lvling up a certain element character is a pain in the middle of a fight ) and I would like to meet other players even if it's just in a player lobby,Positive,299,60
Magpie 89,2020-11-04 13:31:42,Incredible. Would be 5 stars if they were a little more generous with primo gems.,Positive,81,15

Tristan Sow Zhi Lin,2020-11-11 06:30:43,"U might need a high spec phone to play this game. Otherwise, the open world and co op gameplay has been fantastic for me",Positive,120,24
0031 MUAZ FIRDAUS BIN MOHAMMAD AIDIL,2020-09-28 21:23:17,I know I might be a bit selfish but I see these game in youtube ads and it's shows how fluid it is which I assume 60 fps. However in-game setting I can't find to increase the fps cap and stuck with 30 fps instead. I hope devs can increase the cap or make it unlimited FPS because I really want to have it run fluidly,Positive,316,66
Kimberly Nabors,2020-10-06 04:10:39,It's a beautiful game and so far has a great storyline. The mobile controls are a tad difficult and it can get annoying when you don't try to climb or jump over something but your character does anyway. I will continue to play and give more feedback.,Positive,250,47
Zarc Sakaki,2020-09-29 22:20:55,"the game is great, good graphics and gameplay, the reason why i only placed four star was because when i play it on my android oppo for some reason the graphics are glitching the terrain the face of the characters etc. i hope it got to fix soon because i really want it to play on my android also.",Positive,297,59
Dio Brando,2020-09-29 11:24:06,"I believe its already really optimised to the best it can on mobile. But simply put, majority of phones are unable to run such large scale games.

Rahul Yadav,2020-10-07 23:45:21,"The game is great. Excellent grafics,smooth gameplay,awesome sound. The story is great too. But there is one problem. After completing first part,you need to roam alot in the wilds to increase adventure xp. This part should be removed.",Positive,235,38
Aldrine Cagang,2020-10-11 16:42:03,The game is fun and the presentation and mechanisms are also really good. character design also very aesthetically pleasing. I just wish there are more guy characters (you know haha). Also! Please have controller support for mobile version (Android and iOS).,Positive,258,41
Fredy M,2020-10-09 07:52:10,This game is very fun to play. I mean i have stopped playing moba since its stressful and started playing this. Most relaxing and coolest game i have played in a while. Only drawback would be the intense spec requirements this game need to run properly... Maybe fix performance in further updates?,Positive,297,52
Flan Dure,2020-10-08 00:34:20,"Though i have been trouble opening the app, (It keeps saying insuffient storage, which i just cleaned out?

AlfinityTV,2020-10-26 23:33:11,"Okay, played the game, and just WOW. Wish it was an MMORPG though like Aura Kingdom where you are able to do Trade and Vending, has Mounts and Pet System, Costumes, etc. If it were, then this would be the BEST ONLINE GAME IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF GAMING.",Positive,253,49
S3RW44H,2020-10-18 08:58:49,"Good game Just makes my phone too hot too quickly When I was playing for about 30 mins it made my phone too hot though, the game has amazing quality. And when I was doing the xailing Thing it restarted me in the middle of the cook-off",Positive,234,47
akane rin,2020-10-26 04:11:44,"overall this game is great, i love it, but i get banned by using third party software or something like that, though i didn't using it at all, i dont even know how to use it, i already sent them email about this like 1 week ago but there's no reply until now",Positive,258,53
mushroom chae,2020-10-15 01:03:57,"I don't see any problem in this game except for lagging in servers, I don't know if it's only my internet or the server itself, Please fix it because sometimes I automatically disconnected even though I had 40ms, i might change my rating to 5 star when ya'll fix it, Thank you!",Positive,277,52
August Partain,2020-10-07 21:26:46,The g ame is actually fun the only reason I gave it a 4 star is that multi-player you can't unlock teleports on your own world and thats lame but the adventure is amazing the feel of the game and the fact you don't need 2 separate accounts for your phone and on pc is just amazing keep up the good work!!,Positive,304,62
Mochagirl,2020-10-12 04:29:15,I do have a feeling the game is good but overall whenever I try to play it it says I have to free up some storage. And I already freed up some storage even to the most storage takeing apps. So basicly im stuck at the downloading screen....I dont know why but can I please get some help for this..,Positive,296,60
ƒêivo Glanz,2020-10-06 20:46:50,The game is simply gorgeous on max settings. It also turns my phone into an oven. So please include gamepad support as soon as possible. It's a console game so it shouldn't be a problem. 5 stars when I'm able to play with an XBox pad :),Positive,236,47
Swoop_314,2020-09-29 20:26:54,So the game is great but I have one complaint the game would lag a lot so in all the graphics on lowest and I still get a little lag sometimes and other times the game lags so much I can not move my character if there is a way to fix that please do but other that that it is a great game and I love it,Positive,301,68
Gerald Ore,2020-10-02 22:23:03,"It is a very exciting ans enjoying game. However it is not very optimized and ideal for low end devices. Even though I use a newer Helio G85 chipset, It is still very laggy and freezes all the time.

Redstone DeathDrive,2020-09-28 04:21:04,"I can't actually say what the gameplay is like, since servers haven't opened yet, but the game previews, as well as beta gameplay reviews are amazing.

Radish _,2020-10-24 06:30:34,"Its a good game a lot like a fully fledged console game (I know it is on some consoles and pc) I like it and it had a visual glitch where one part of the screen looked blocky, but overall really good game",Positive,204,43
Aclulaid Annuvera,2020-10-08 02:36:08,"A gotcha without an autobattle system, good solid gameplay mechanics based around interacting with nature's elements in the world, serviceable controls, and good graphics if you care, or like the style. Though I feel like the shop items are designed to confuse moreso than other titles.",Positive,286,46
Rozaliya Olenyeva,2020-10-05 18:26:50,Overall a fantastic game but the only downside is the gacha rates. If you change the rates to 90 pulls is guaranteed the UP character then it would be better considering the fact that you need duplicates to upgrade their constellation I hope you change this soon because this game has alot of potential :),Positive,305,55
D3XT 229,2020-10-11 14:22:53,"This game looks amazing but the animation and audio of the characters are a bit glitchy, can you sort that out please. It be a real pleasure. Thanks. Edit: By the way, I love gliding in this game, I always tend to do it a lot, is fun!",Positive,234,48
Mardy Razon,2020-09-30 01:35:02,IT IS DEFINITELY THR BEST ACTION RPG IN MOBILE HISTORY! But sadly I should have given 5. But they have issues on running with 5th gen ios devices.

Bryan T,2020-10-28 05:01:04,"Would be a 5 star rating if they bumped the odds of pulling characters up a little bit and made some drastic and much needed resin changes. Overall good game, but has potential to be great!",Positive,189,36
Jake Reed,2020-10-05 09:28:28,"Game is very fun, graphics are great. My only complaint is the inability to move the controls. There is way too much empty screen on the edge and the controls are too close to the middle of the screen. Please allow for us to move controls around the screen.",Positive,257,49
mary anne,2020-10-05 22:31:32,Uh hey developers I sent you mail on your gmail but it is been 2days ago and still there is no reply but it is okay I will leave my feedback here. Your game was soo magnificent but it is soo glitchy on Mediatek proccessor by the way I'm using Oppo Reno 3.. during first I fought stormterror my screen is full of purple and blues because if stormterror's texture I hope you'll fix it as soon as you can thank you!,Positive,412,82
Dale Nacario,2020-10-10 12:48:41,The reason I gave this game a 4 star is because I cannot play in Co-op instantly like for example you and your brother plays this game only to find out they can't play together like imagine how fun it would be if u both would start playing lv1 until they keep stronger and stronger.,Positive,282,55
Nervyvt.,2020-09-28 10:13:55,"I haven't gotten that far in the game yet but I'm already having fun exploring the open world and fighting monsters. The only problem I have is that the game lags so much even on the lowest of settings, it can really be a bother when your in the middle of battle or a cut scene appears.",Positive,286,57
Joshua Vitollo,2020-10-06 06:18:31,Great game but very demanding on your device. It's fun and looks good graphics wise but Takes an hour and half to download everything and even on a mid range phone with all graphics setting on low it still lags a little and freezes up on loading scenes. If you want to enjoy the game smoothly you better have a high end device.,Positive,327,63
Anonymous User,2020-09-30 13:46:29,It's just on the endless bridge forever. When does the game start? It is a very calming and beautiful bridge though. (Oh is it because i don't have the Google Play game framework installed? I'm not willing to sit through spammy notifications for any game...),Positive,258,45
Zara Cheel,2020-09-30 10:24:48,"The game is great. But even with under 70 ms the game gets laggy. I have everything set to the lowest and I still encounter this lag even just being in the city and usually it does it when I'm exploring, doing quests, or killing NPCs.

Lowell Tan,2020-10-04 17:51:49,Overall a good game. I have it both on my mobile and PS4 but I can't use the same account on both so that is a bit of a negative for me. Loading times can get a bit long but it's bearable. I having a good time so far so have a go if you want to.,Positive,245,57
Kenneth Butler,2020-10-05 11:55:43,Great game. Beautiful graphics and gameplay. Rates suck and and controls getting into menus on ps4 suck as well. I don't know how many times I can quick launch map and it'll take me to either my adventure book or wish page. On the mobile side I can't complain though.,Positive,267,50
Dexeron Starsurge,2020-09-30 11:56:37,"Game looks, sounds and plays amazingly. But it needs some MAJOR optimization. I have a decent phone, but the cutscene visuals freeze but the audio keeps playing and I've missed important stuff a few times now, both involving a certain big blue creature right at the start.",Positive,272,47
ADS,2020-10-03 12:57:27,"Love the game, can't even tell it's for mobile as it looks better and plays better than most AAA games. Though I got a audio issue where it crackles a bit. Happens with headphones s too but not as much with Bluetooth. Switching serves reduced it but not a lot.",Positive,260,50
Dakodracos,2020-10-05 16:58:43,Ok i know I made a 5 star review before but this time is different mainly because this game just assumes you picked female and im a little annoyed some dialog is completely different then what the text says an example is when your having a serious conversation paimons dialog is completely random but her text is serious and I for one chose the brother in the start but when the text says he referring to me the dialog says she and when it says sister in text the dialog says brother my only problem.,Positive,500,95
MagWrath,2020-10-16 17:38:36,"One of the best if not the best game on mobile, the quality of this game is spectacular, triple A console like game, the only thing I was disappointed with is no Controller Support, such a console like game surely needs a controller support, other than that the game is 10/10",Positive,275,51
Llama Plays,2020-10-14 00:20:26,I do wish the co-op was flushed out like being able to continue the story with friends or at least being able to activate a statue of the seven. I also don't understand why others can't get the loot of chest on other players worlds. Other than that this game is pretty fun would recommend it.,Positive,292,56

Coffee Emblem,2020-10-02 16:02:00,Really loving the gameplay and the art style! My only gripe is that the controls are a bit too cluttered for mobile; I end up jumping when I want to attack. Some way to rearrange the virtual controls would be much appreciated.,Positive,226,42
syamil mirza,2020-10-11 05:59:58,the game is great but i hate it when the camera is auto zooming close to the character and it's more annoying when it happens during battle. i hope developers do something about this like make setting for camera stay far away. auto camera is just nice but sometimes annoying.,Positive,275,50
Joseph Ehmann,2020-10-16 15:12:12,"This game is hands down the best of 2020 for mobile, I love everything about it. Even the fact that I can fight any level monster I want if I'm level 1.

honeymilk.,2020-11-05 09:58:30,"i think other servers should be allowed to be played with other servers, it's unfair to other people, and they should be allowed to play Co-op on with people on other servers.",Positive,175,32
Order Drag Drag,2020-09-30 01:03:04,"It's a good solo open world RPG game, with cool animations, characters, features etc. But I truly recommended playing it in PC, in order to grasp the full excitement of this game play it PC or Console. Only play it in Mobile devices or phone if you have no other choice.",Positive,270,51
Suicide Bunny,2020-10-23 08:45:19,"Everything is good, unless you're playing it on mobile phone. It turns my phone into a hot pocket after 1 hour of playing and please fix the god damn server aswell, i need to use vpn to get a good ping for playing this game like wth.",Positive,233,47
First Name Last Name,2020-10-03 23:32:21,"An actual good free game app?

Gehlen Sonny Chan,2020-09-28 12:12:12,"Like most games from the developer they really have a good concept of an open world system, play style, art and story line. Add a good graphics out put then your set. The down side that i see is that while there are many players would definitely love playing this game on pc and console but not so much on mobile. There is a need to take account and fact that most mobile rpg players will only continue playing if there is an auto feature. May it be a semi-auto or full auto.",Positive,475,93
Wei theng Tan,2020-11-05 19:44:08,Cost to draw character with Primogems are really a bit high I hope publisher would really notice about this issue also materials u need to farm for a new character is a but hard other than this two issues everything is quite perfect for me.

Jacob Harina,2020-10-12 11:49:31,I really liked the game... There not too many bugs in the game because the develops are working hard to fix any issue everyday...

M.,2020-09-28 09:32:31,"Pretty nice so far. I'll update the review once I play more. Two things that bothered me: No gamepad support, and way too many currencies. It's okay to have microtransactions here, but why is there so much conversion??",Positive,218,38
Jade Greene,2020-10-13 09:43:16,"Would be a five out of five if it offered gamepad support. I'm honestly continually surprised that a game like this can be played on a phone, and run well. I can't wait to see how it improves, and only hope that they offer gamepad support sooner rather than later.",Positive,264,50
Darkproviso17,2020-09-29 12:26:41,"The biggest issue is the server/network. Less than 30 minutes and the game just starts lagging, doesn't matter if your network is good or not. Another issue is the load time, way too long. Except from that, awesome game",Positive,219,39
Chris Mac,2020-10-22 23:52:47,Was probably the most fun game I have ever played on a phone with one exception. Some world bosses are impossible to beat and need a complete redesign because it makes the game not fun.,Positive,185,35
Siziline,2020-10-06 22:15:56,It's fun but you need a pretty good phone to run it when ever j play it my phone starts to over heat and it seems like it is struggling. And it is also kinda laggy but that is not a big problem. But other than that it is a fun and great game.,Positive,242,54

Sean Cortes,2020-10-16 10:23:55,"Very solid start. Best graphics I've seen on a phone game. Story is a little weak but the world is vibrant. I hear there's issues with endgame content that will probably have to be tweaked in the future but as of now, I'm enjoying the game.",Positive,240,46

That Dyno,2020-10-12 04:35:24,"I know Mihoyo can do this but I at least wanted them to optimize the game a bit.

Rodrigo Medina,2020-10-01 03:43:39,"Some aspects like fighting and exploring are hurt by the controls here on mobile. I have played others before that were not as wonky.

Peter Dietsch,2020-10-06 16:19:09,"The game is very fun, and the open world offers a significant amount of exploration. However, this game would be more fun if it was p2p and you had to unlock new characters instead of randomly getting one through the wish system.",Positive,229,42
Lord Snarff,2020-10-19 09:47:56,Great game. The mobile controls are a bit clunky but most mobile games are. The gotcha rates are forgiving but as free to play it will take more time to get what you want.,Positive,171,34

If this gets more caps and ways to earn or even remove that thing i might give you 5 stars, because i see the game becoming p2w because of that resin, but its still f2p friendly",Positive,498,97

Jozi Mitsubishi,2020-11-15 07:01:52,"Love it , just that it lags at times but other than that it's a great game",Positive,74,17
l,2020-11-14 00:40:13,"The game is really good, but i wish that we could connect mobile and ps4 and cuz of that i gave only 4 stars",Positive,108,24
Ogm Professionals,2020-10-20 03:52:05,Found a few spots that i got stuck in. Fortunately you are able to simply teleport out in a pinch. Would be nice to zoom out more also. Sometimes the angle is too tight especially when fighting on hills.,Positive,203,39
Rin Garrison,2020-10-05 09:49:50,"Beautiful game, interesting story and characters. Would prefer if controller support were a thing, because I find the on screen joystick to be a little bit clunky, and the UI is a little bit overwhelming with all the buttons and character icons",Positive,244,42
bailey waller,2020-09-28 17:50:46,"My only gripe is that you can't buy the characters outright. I would pay 10 bucks for a character if I get them right away, but I won't pay to use the gacha because of my previous experiences with the system. The game has potential though.",Positive,239,46
Jubert Ciscar,2020-09-28 18:13:35,The game itself is excellent but there's one thing I want you to do. Please make the game more smoother and optimize tho my device is flagship its all smooth but I want the game to be more lighter so it won't heat on my device or simply do anything about the heating issue...,Positive,275,54
NoNeedToKnow,2020-10-28 02:51:14,"IT'S REALLY COOL. My only problem is it lags a lot. But overall, this game is Addictive! It's make me regret opening it because right now I am going to be more active in this game!",Positive,180,36
Reaver Zero,2020-10-14 18:16:25,"Can't say I'm satisfied because my phone has a lot of space and ram but the game is still laggy even though I toned down the graphics to lowest, fix the lag and it'll be a very great game. Please fix the lags and bugs especially when going inside structural places like houses and dungeons",Positive,289,55
Brian Oney,2020-09-29 10:51:48,Great game definitely a next gen open world game for mobile with that being said this game definitely made for newer phone makes your phone run super hot even on lowest graphics and that causes some lagging and battery drain on my galaxy S7 so if u have somthing even older then that or equivalent I dont recommand this game will prolly fry your phone.,Positive,352,65
Adorkable Randomness,2020-10-01 04:23:53,"This game is freaking awesome!!!! The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars like most is the whole glitching problem it has with cutscenes. Other than that, solid!!! I can't wait until it comes out on Switch!!!!",Positive,209,37
Malcolm Pugh,2020-10-07 00:29:08,Everything is amazing in this game except for Coop and the variety of enemies. My main concern is coop as someone who introduces others to the game. Please remove some restrictions so I can play with them and help them catch up.,Positive,228,42
Felipe Navarro,2020-09-29 13:00:29,"If I could I would rate 3.5 stars but I really like this game, great graphics even with the lowest resolution settings. But in some time specially before cinematics or during a Battle my game glitch. To play this game in excellent performance you need a premium Phone.",Positive,268,48
Arif Iskandar,2020-10-07 07:33:54,"Everything was great except coop. The coop exploration is kinda boring, there is not so much things to do. The loot system in coop also a bit annoying, why only the host can loot everything in the chest? Hope dev can look onto this give a great update on coop.",Positive,260,50
A.I. Kuuhaku,2020-10-04 19:51:47,"hmm its very good besides lag during cutscenes . i dont lag when playing mostly so its not my phone specs 8) f2p friendly game .. for now for sure new monsters will be added, also new heroes for those monsters so old op heroes will leave meta/be outdated materials for wish/summon arent easy to get and need a lot of grinding.",Positive,326,62
Ema Rshiney,2020-10-10 14:13:02,I love this game because i can travel every inch in the map.. But the problem is sometimes i got server connection problem while playing then can't enter the game for few times while i can open any other game without connection problem.. Please fix it.. Im not sure if only me face this problem,Positive,294,55
Oliver Forst,2020-10-19 20:40:21,"If Venti gets added to the party later on the story rather than being lost forever in the now ended Ballad of Goblets wish, I'll give this 5 stars. Other than that, everything else is amazing for a F2P game",Positive,206,40
Jonathan,2020-10-07 09:52:01,"Amazing game, it's easy to play and has fantastic graphics, the only issue is it takes it a very long time to load cutscenes, I think this is because it's built closer to a console or pc game, but it still is fun.",Positive,213,43
Mehnaj Jimy,2020-10-15 11:10:19,"This game is great, but there are a few problems. The character drop rate is too low, you should have the ability to change a dungeon to easy mode, and make adventure rank leveling easier. The rest is great tho.",Positive,211,40
Odins Recruiter,2020-10-24 10:51:23,"Game has been amazingly fun. Wish I could share save with my ps4 but ill stick with my mobile. Great job on the open world, very entertaining and full of content. Keep up the good work.",Positive,185,36
Jason Gladitarus,2020-09-28 23:48:47,"It seems like a decent game with good graphics, but i couldn't really play much as, sadly, my redmi note 7 apparently isn't quite powerful enough to run the game smoothly. Maybe if i upgrade my phone next time I'll give it a go again, it really seems fun.",Positive,255,49
Andre Suer,2020-09-29 12:35:02,"So far I'm really loving this game. The only turn I in this game is the online co op. The biggest reason I got this game was to play with my friend, but since the guest play gets nothing for this we decided that it wasn't a good idea",Positive,233,49
Black Taufz,2020-11-12 16:59:13,There's a problem when aiming when using Flish. It hard to move,Positive,63,12
Marie Azucena,2020-10-07 08:12:51,"Game it self is amazing but, please make it more optimized with phones, mine is a latest snap dragon set but it still laggy and freezes :( Im looking forward to this game, and even with the lowest setting possible, the game still lags and freezes. Please make it optimized with phone users",Positive,289,53
do soo eun,2020-10-21 03:11:21,"It is very good.When you log in once and you will not be log out ü§£ .But in my opinion,the camera sensibility is not good. When fight,the mood is bad.",Positive,149,30
bunne bee,2020-10-13 09:13:43,It's a great game with good graphics and story line but when I've been playing for a bit and come across a difficult creacher I would have it almost dead but then it just some how get full health then its just wasting my time when I spend like 5 mins on it and I'm still trying to kill it,Positive,288,60
Sol Luna,2020-09-28 12:18:41,"Played in the final CBT (CBT3 fyi), it was neat, review atm is just for that CBT experience, since right now we are all preloading and anyone who reviews bad because it's unplayable should actually y'know... LOOK AT THE RELEASE DATE. Seriously guys its unplayable because this is the preloading period, wait till Sept 28th on w/e time zone for actual launch.",Positive,358,62
Aasd Aasd,2020-10-03 09:35:11,"Very good experience , that is the game we all dream to play on mobile , it's exactly like pc or console gaming experience but there is fatal mistake , battery is running out very fast , our batteries are in danger so please do some updates to fx this serious issue",Positive,265,52
Nikiller ;,2020-10-16 03:54:59,Very very very amazing game even on mobile. One thing I think that would truly make this game really 5 stars is controller support on mobile. If this was Implemented I'd definitely come and change my review to a 5 star. Wish I could just give 4 and a half but whatever,Positive,268,52
Lan Bill,2020-11-02 11:25:38,"Fun time, but obviously pay to win so I can't fully support it.",Positive,63,13
Koy,2020-11-07 19:39:10,Great game overall. Needs more content for the lategame.,Positive,56,9
Thalyta Raisya,2020-11-07 15:37:53,the graphics was great! the story line kinda boring but its okay,Positive,64,12
Dyan Rey,2020-11-02 12:39:10,"Game is very fun and good. I'll make this a 5 star if you introduce a guild system. And by that, I mean with other players",Positive,122,26
Jean-Charbel Adjanohoun,2020-11-11 06:45:53,"P2p and resins are very annoying, can't get new units resins so hard to get once you're higher.",Positive,95,18
Pleh Meh,2020-11-10 07:12:27,So far it's pretty good. Too bad we don't get to customize our avatar/character. I wanna play a little dress up teehee!,Positive,119,22
PROminence Starblaze,2020-09-28 17:11:20,So far so good like playing the game i played before but with a level up system. That only i have a problem is the joystick for movement it is a little bit clunky it's not smooth and sometimes the fps drops when using skills in multiple enemies but other than that thr game and story is good,Positive,291,58
mikkel stornberg,2020-10-18 04:28:15,"Not a bad game, so far not sure why it is online though, doesnt really make sense to me as I'm playing solo non stop, would be nice to have some interaction with other players.",Positive,176,35
ayayyayayayayaya,2020-10-05 16:55:13,"I really love this game, amazing graphics, awesome gameplay etc. But the reason im giving it a 4 star and not a 5 is because its not optimised the best for mobile, and i understand that this game is also on PS4 and PC but i really Genshin Impact were better optimised on mobile.",Positive,278,54
Taufiq Hidayat,2020-10-02 11:38:37,"Well the graphic is great, but too heavy compare to honkai impact, but we need customize control because i always accidently hit jump button while looking around, and when using amber or any range char, its a bit hard to hit the target while shooting with thumb fingger, overall is good",Positive,286,51
CeL 1916,2020-10-10 16:45:25,"Damn, this is a beautiful game! sound design and graphics are superb. it does burn a lot of battery though and is meant for higher end device. my PocoF1 seems to handle it fine, but sometimes it heatup. hence the 4 star. but yeah a must try game",Positive,245,48
Ivan Carrillo,2020-10-26 00:54:41,"So far so good, the only bad thing is the gacha but like any other game nowadays, you need to play daily and gather currency to keep trying and get something good.",Positive,163,32
Leo Dorazio,2020-09-29 13:57:52,"The gameplay is outstanding, but there is one bug that has been happening to me with the sound.. It becomes glitchy after 30 minutes of me playing the game. I hope you can fix it, otherwise the game is awsome!",Positive,209,40
Socko420MP,2020-10-20 22:58:32,Great game I thought It was going to be pay to win like every other mobile game but so far it isn't definitely recommended it only a little bit of stutter but it should get better if I mess with like 1 setting.,Positive,210,43
DERPY SLICE,2020-09-29 02:44:17,"I really do like this game over all tho havent found targeting system that targets enemies. Wouldnt bother me if I had roll button or wen I skip away with run if it kept my eyes on the general area of the enemies. Also targeting the bow, it's kinda hard to aim with a fone using finger, I am grateful for aim and 2 shoots buttons but dot too big Get a Breath of the Wild feel but a lil less smooth Was hoping for char custo if they let me name should let me customize I hav to type vague to fit sry",Positive,498,104
Rm Mahfuz,2020-10-27 19:19:55,"I would have rated it 5 star but this rng of mine sucks. I don't get any good characters from wish. Please increase the droprate. Other than that, everything else is just as exceptional as anyone can expect.",Positive,207,38
lovisdyinginside wp,2020-11-02 16:27:36,"its great, but one time the game froze and i had to restart the game",Positive,68,15
WeebMeDaddy,2020-10-02 13:13:29,"Nice graphics and quite good story but the gameplay is too simple, would've been better if u can block and parry. Also the world is too dead not that many npc walking around and interacting making it feels like a lonely world. If u bois can add those it's a 5 star from me",Positive,272,54
Alexander Tan,2020-10-16 18:14:43,"PC/Console quality game on mobile. Good story and great graphics. Top notch japanese voice acting coming from well known VA's. Great graphical settings to adjust, so you can favor battery or graphics. My only gripe is hoping that mihoyo would would add controller support.",Positive,272,44
Subhabrata Gupta,2020-09-29 20:01:25,"Awesome game with huge open world experience and many quests works fine on low end devices also with graphics medium, rendering high and sfx low which will make the settings balanced. 4 star for only one thing server ping is very high for that reason lags are frequently occurring hence please try to fix the ping asap.(ex.ping:400-500ms in Asia server)",Positive,353,60
Mary Shuk,2020-10-08 06:05:18,"I like how it looks and controls on mobile but cutscenes were displayed as a black screen with a stuttering sound, probably because my phone is not the most powerful, so will continue playing on PC only. Thanks for cross platform cloud saves.",Positive,242,43
Ronnel Lee,2020-10-09 13:46:17,edited: it's a great game though might i suggest that can we edit the in screen buttons? because sometimes i accidentally pressed the attack button while gliding it might be a good thing if we can edit/ placed all the in screen buttons hope it will be added in the next update..,Positive,278,52
Alex Cullip,2020-10-06 22:51:20,"Great game so far, just wish there was a way to connect my bluetooth keyboard to the game and use that to move around. You guys should add a setting option that allows it for mobile devices. But otherwise its still very enjoyable!",Positive,230,43
choco -mint,2020-10-15 23:03:30,Good Game and all. The only one of its kind so far on mobile and very well thought off from the world and gameplay. The only issue I have with this game is the optimisation on Exynos devices are bad and the rates for a Gacha is exceptionally pretty garbage to at 0.6%,Positive,267,53
Miku Nanako,2020-10-02 22:41:46,Im not sure if its a bug or not but when using headphones their voice sounded like a robot.And the game crashes twice.The fps drops and the game crahsed.I've been looking forward to this game since the day they first announce it and literally bough a new phone for it.I hope you look into those issue if its isnt just my device.wirh Really High expectation Thank you,Positive,366,67
JoJo594,2020-09-28 08:45:00,"Everything is pretty much perfect, except for the sound. Dear lord the sound. I don't know if it was just me, but it seems life the sound files got corrupted when I downloaded the game. Other than that, this seems to be a very promising game.",Positive,242,46
Nathan Angelo Kanapi,2020-10-02 19:43:49,"If the mobile version had controller or mouse and keyboard support, I'd rate it a 5. Come on, add alternative controls... I've played this on PC and PS4 and the experience is vastly superior to playing on my phone screen without an external controller.",Positive,252,44
Sci Duckz,2020-10-18 21:24:35,"Its pretty good game with amazing story, but you really need a good connection to avoid disconnected from the server..hope the developer adds customized for the characters and I'll give it five stars",Positive,199,33
„Äå bde „Äç,2020-10-19 17:04:56,"very fun at the beginning but after that it feels empty, like its still in early stages of early acess. unlike games like risk of rain 2 which felt complete at the beginning of early access.",Positive,190,36
David Lee,2020-10-11 07:33:19,"I chose my nickname as JL0422, but the screen displays it as J****22 with one more asterisk than there should be. Is this a intended security feature, or a bug? Also, the quest that comes right after rescuing Jack is more impossible, at least with the boss being able to self-recover.",Positive,284,51
David Jeremiah Malazarte,2020-10-18 12:39:14,Nice game... I hope we could pick up items faster and he can pick it up maybe just a little bit farther... we don't necessarily need to find a sweet spot to pick them up.,Positive,170,35
Angelica Cope,2020-10-13 08:18:04,"I have something to say.. i finished Dvalin's storyline and this is what I found.. there are momentary plotlines that mentions the gender of the traveler itself.. i was kinda hoping that you could make an honorary changes throughout the game like changing the villain's name as ""the Princess"" instead of ""the Prince"" if you choose the male character.. that way we can provide some of the outcome of the story",Positive,408,71
Swirlspot Kitty,2020-10-04 00:46:25,"Lovely game from what I've seen. However, right after I receive the glider and test it out, I move to a cut scene. It starts out with someone saying ""The sky."" But from then on the screen is black and the audio is fuzzy. How can I watch this cut scene?",Positive,252,51
Fate Rainheart,2020-09-29 11:59:39,"The graphics are good but obviously for the time being, I'm not as invested as I am with HI3. I would probably recommend most ppl to play this game on PC at first, because this overheats my phone even on the lowest settings for me.",Positive,231,45
Emmanuel Segundo,2020-10-27 19:34:55,"It exceeded my expectation. I thought it was an RPG with an auto-attack but it is not. There are some missing features required for an RPG but overall, it's a good game.",Positive,169,32
Francis Kok,2020-10-06 02:58:32,"Clearly, a somewhat 'Breath of the Wild' take of open world exploration. I haven't come across any RPG games unless you count for 'Final Fantasy' series, but playing a high quialty game on an adroid is a must praise. Hopefully this game is here to stay.",Positive,253,46
Gaurav Giri,2020-10-29 17:10:32,In love with its gameplay but didn't enjoying the graphics much it seems likes a bit unstable,Positive,93,17

Terrarian 5758,2020-11-10 08:34:32,I like the game and its story but I'd like camera sensitivity is kinda wack and I couldn't change it but other wise a good game,Positive,127,26
Young Amos,2020-11-15 23:02:17,it's very laggy on lower-end phones and takes a long time to download files,Positive,75,14
jesaya joan,2020-10-19 05:20:00,I have really great experience on this game... But more I play I feel like this game is out of contents I already explore every single place and I kinda feel empty now. And the resin system is kinda stupid.,Positive,206,40
Prince Senpai,2020-10-18 07:36:54,"Amazing game honestly, it's amazing. but the rates for 5 Stars is not good tbh. Aside from the Resin issue which I heard they fixing the next biggest problem is probably the 5 star rate.",Positive,186,35
Brandon Watkins,2020-10-10 09:13:26,"As a mobile user, my only complaints are how hard some of the smaller buttons are to press, like the remove keys when enhancing, but combat feels nice. World building and story telling are nothing to write home about, but its still enjoyable.",Positive,242,43
Amisha,2020-10-18 12:53:59,"The game is absolutely amazing, but I am facing payment issues. I've been trying for past 9-10 days and my payment always gets declined. It says ""Can't find the requested ID, contact the seller"".",Positive,195,34
FreshJessie,2020-10-01 11:01:30,"Pretty good game, especially considering that its free. Graphics are really good for a mobile game, touch controls are bearable. The writing is a bit flat but for a free rpg this is a no brainer to download.",Positive,207,38
Josiah Duncan,2020-10-02 13:53:42,This game was almost perfect. I enjoy all the elements of the game thus far however I really wished this had a pvp mode. Seeing that's it's cross platform a pvp mode will maximize the use of that system and add some competitive longevity to the game.,Positive,250,47
J Thompson,2020-10-03 01:46:12,Loving the game. Please make it game controller compatible. I hate playing using my touch screen it significantly slows down the gameplay and reduces the enjoyability. If it is compatible please recommend which controller users should get to maximize their experience.,Positive,268,41
Carlos Sinaga,2020-10-12 10:26:41,"Nothing to say, this game is too good, but there's a small request for me, add costumize button size, sometime i often miss touch the button because its small and sometimes the game force close out of knowwhere its really ruin my gameplay but overall genshin is really good game.",Positive,279,50
Mina Karlsen,2020-10-03 12:55:02,"It's really fun, the story is amazing and there's always something to do. Although some of the cut scenes bug out and I cant watch them and some of the locates of the essences to use on the statue dont actually have them in the area",Positive,232,46
Mike M,2020-10-21 02:48:46,What a great game. Great amount of characters and weapons fully explorable. You can spend hours getting long lost and keep going and still have more to do,Positive,154,28
Caleb Banuelos,2020-10-02 17:58:42,"I love the amazing open world, but when insaw the hanger logo I thought I was going to dress up my characters. Though disappointed in that because the guards armor looks cool, I would definitely love to have the option to customize clothes too!",Positive,244,44
bananakwek,2020-10-24 11:43:04,Love this game but the annoying thing is that when battling the screen just auto rotates so much that it is hard to tell what is going on. I hope there is an option to stop this,Positive,177,37
Ace64xl,2020-09-30 09:17:51,I have to say a gorgeous game graphic amazibg character design fantastic the story amazin. But their is a problem the cutscene they look amazin but the speech is glitching out and thats what slows down the cutscene that is a problem with it if you can fix it this game would be perfect.,Positive,286,54
CHaoz,2020-09-29 17:06:02,"I normally really hate anime like games and Fantasy like RPG games, but this game really changed my mind!!!

Manas Singh,2020-10-25 11:41:37,"The game size is I think the largest ever in google play store. You wondering how is that possible? As you can see, the download size is only 137 mb. But when you install the game and run it, it needs a 5 gb internal download. But i would appreciate developers for bringing a 30gb game mobile devices.",Positive,301,58
Eman De Pedro,2020-10-02 16:42:17,I am speechless on how beautiful this game is the graphics are smooth please upgrade the graphics more in mobile phones. The game is chill the story is not bad too. Keep up the good work. I will rate this 4 stars for now.,Positive,221,44
Munchy McBubby,2020-10-10 13:32:29,Good game but mobile controls and item pick up is a bit annoying. Gatcha chances are abysmal but not needed. Free characters are fun. Add auto pick in mobile please. It's hard to catch lizards while changing camera angle and pressing pick up... plus pick up lag.,Positive,262,47
tfm m,2020-10-31 18:35:51,Great game but it needs to support wireless controller on mobile.,Positive,65,11
Queen Esie,2020-10-03 22:48:57,"The game is amazing addictive beautiful! The only bad thing would be that you can't customize your characters. You can't change their complexion, like be black for instance. It's disappointing but the game is still pretty good",Positive,226,37
Christian Abbago,2020-10-16 05:34:47,"Whats the use of massive big open world if your the only player in the map, i really highly suggest that you make a open world with more and really more player working together....

Osman Nezha,2020-10-13 11:01:19,"the game is asweome,everything about it is really good but there is one problem,i can play the game at 30 fps and highest settings possible and have no problem at all but if i switch to 60fps even in lowest settings my device will heat up as hell,can we do som about that?",Positive,272,53
Brendan S Mk,2020-10-23 19:21:15,Very good nice graphics and nice gameplay and controls. Great characters n elementals. Just it would be better to speed up the resin refills. And to reduce the price of wishing gems.,Positive,182,32

Giovanni Giangeruso,2020-10-05 06:26:30,"I am absolutely in love with the game on PC and got it on my phone to play on the go. This would be a five star, but I truly wish there was controller/gamepad support so that I could connect my controller and play normally.",Positive,223,45
Faere Inc.,2020-10-17 00:51:06,"Please add more graphical options i.e. draw distance sliders and further toning down resolution for low to mid-end phones, mobile gameplay seems to be overlooked with how inaccessible the game can be with the very low framerate, and with harder domains and heavy cutscene the game can end up crashing.",Positive,301,50
Frostwolf,2020-09-29 00:13:15,"My experience so far has been amazing, been able to play such a game on a mobile device is nice. The only reason I can give it a 5* rating is just one thing, PLEASE MAKE CONTROLLER COMPATIBLE. Much appreciated if you could make this possible",Positive,241,46
Hi C,2020-10-06 16:51:13,"It's more fun and relaxing to play than most games right now. Gameplay and the world feels alive and amazing to explore. Maybe everyone should have some voices, even the random npc's but other than that. It's fun, play it",Positive,221,40
John Regalado,2020-10-01 09:36:12,It's pretty fun once you get the hang of it. Definitely harder to play on mobile than pc or console though. Mostly due to camera angles and adjusting them in combat. Beyond that though it's very enjoyable.,Positive,205,37
Nilrith,2020-09-29 14:49:37,It would be great if there was an option that would reduce the texture of the grass and/or water just to help with FPS. I sometimes get significantly reduced FPS whenever I land in water or when I'm viewing a grassfield and moving the camera too fast.,Positive,251,47
raj Gohil,2020-10-15 09:40:27,"Game is awesome, I love the open world of this game but I don't like only one thing which is time limit challenges in which we have to kill slimes or mages within 30secs or 1min.

Edward Avila,2020-10-13 06:24:50,"Love this game, however it would be great if they could add controllet support on mobile, so i can use my Xbox one controller, would make it so much more comfortable to play and would attract more people to play it.",Positive,215,41
John Ronald Custodio,2020-10-14 13:57:31,"The game is good but the resin system primarily needs to be changed , not saying we should remove it but reworked, similar to what tectone said in his video if we remove the resin then people would unhealthy when they just grind the game for days and just stop playing after a week, increasing resin cap with your world level, giving a daily fragile resin and for loging in and finishing commisions and or reducing the resin cooldown from eight minutes to a minimum of 3, this is a needed change",Positive,495,92
Jared Davis,2020-10-12 23:06:27,It's a great game and doesn't pressure you to make in app purchases. But it's also still an early release and can be a little buggy. I would love an option for an external controller but for now we're forced to use touch controls.,Positive,230,44
Skyler George,2020-10-23 17:35:02,Probably the only mobile game I will ever consider as an actual game. It exceeded my expectations. If the controls were not wonky I would give this a 5 star.,Positive,157,30

Stefan Desimone,2020-10-19 09:02:57,"This game seems amazing might be my next favorite mobile game. However, I do wish there was more of a character customization for your character. I feel like it would be a pretty awesome aspect of the game",Positive,205,38
ExS,2020-10-03 18:54:56,"Add a lock feature for the fire button, so you can hold the fire button with ur thumbs while using ur index finger to aim.

John Felix Rullan,2020-10-15 11:12:59,"Almost perfect everything, the open-world gameplay, the MMORPG things are great, the Gacha element is ok. The only problem is the Resin system, the Resin system is going to ruin the game long-term, unless y'all don't do anything about it.",Positive,238,40
wan mohammad hizal wan zainal,2020-10-05 11:22:50,"The movement controls are a bit quirky, could use some fine tuning. For example, the character tend to climb walls to easily, until it becomes an annoyance. Camera movement is also haphazard.",Positive,191,32
Sharina Bayot,2020-10-25 00:56:27,"the game is very good, it has its own story and its graphic is like anime. the reason why I gave only 4 stars is because the graphic is very high that my phone can't load it",Positive,173,37
916 sharanprakash Aravindraj,2020-09-30 20:44:53,"The game is good but at least you must add some interesting characters to battle , rewards are too lame.

Personal Satellite,2020-10-11 03:24:19,"So far its I really fun experience. There are microtransactions, but the developers have done a great job of not making them feel predatory. The only time you see the shop is if you go looking for it.",Positive,200,38
nanu04,2020-10-11 07:29:57,"I really like this game, and I think it has a lot of potential. Though I think there's some problems for example: the lag & the restarting when going out of the app. Besides that I think it's an amazing game!! Thx for all the hard work!",Positive,236,47

Toni Tiihonen,2020-09-29 16:10:58,"Graphics are fantastic and the game is well optimized (especially on desktop 4K/60hz).

Sebastien Negrito,2020-10-10 18:48:05,"Everything is good, but for some reason cutscenes are choppy and lag behind, even though the gameplay has been 100% smooth, and although the default controls are fine, adding controller support would make it so much better.",Positive,223,37
Veka,2020-10-11 10:14:26,This is a really good game. Now the only problem is the marksman camera angles. Like when you are near a wall and trying to use charged shot the camera angles makes it so that you can't see where you shoot.,Positive,206,41

Reza Bazri,2020-09-28 13:10:40,"The game itself is really good and beautiful. But the performance not good enough. Gameplay is smooth but sometimes frame drop happens, also battery draining is massive, never seen something like this before Please optimize the game",Positive,232,37
Angel Ramirez,2020-10-05 01:51:47,"Gacha pulls suck something harsh. Everything else is amazing! Beautiful graphics, sprawling open world and great story and characters. 99% of this game is free but the most useful and sometimes MANDATORY characters cost big bucks or massive luck to get.",Positive,253,41
Alejandro Rojas,2020-10-06 01:25:15,"I just can't stop playing this game. Has a great story, graphs, mechanics everything... is amaizing. However I would like to be able to use my xbox controller within the game. It could be anoying to play just with touchscreen.",Positive,226,40
Kenji Muramoto,2020-10-02 11:09:29,The joystick control and skills are really close together on a Note 10+. Seems like it might not be optimized for it. The game itself isn't bad at all. I just really dislike the controls on mobile.,Positive,197,37
Yeon Tan,2020-10-01 15:08:40,"Hey, the graphics is all good and smooth gameplay, my only problems is that everytime a cutscene plays it lags and it doesn't seem to play plus there's no skip button so I have to wait for too long. Please fix these issues.",Positive,223,43
Ricky Puohotaua,2020-10-05 14:29:05,"Really good, however it crashes on my phone after a little while, hope they find a way to fix this coz its the best game I've played in awhile, plenty to do even in free to play hope it stays that way",Positive,200,42

Beast Gaming,2020-10-06 18:08:22,This game is just...... I am speechless with its graphics and gameplay and story mode but gacha system sucks because most of the time you get duplicates and even if you spin 90 times no guarantee that you will get the character you want so i only have request please add the bonding fate and change gacha system,Positive,311,58
taboo216,2020-10-01 15:22:26,Honestly really hooked on the game. The only gripe I have is there is no controller support. Touch screen controls in any game like this is a nightmare for me so it really accelerates my brun out rate while playing.,Positive,215,40
L TilibanS,2020-09-29 02:27:19,"I love this game, especially the fact that is a open world, but it's a little bit laggy. I play on european servers whit 50 ping on a Redmi 8 but sometimes the animations freeze or lag. Also I'd like to personalize the controls. Thank you",Positive,238,46

S√©bastien Grenier,2020-10-04 20:45:11,"The game is good, I like the look, it doesn't feel that much has a mobile game, which it's great. the only problem I got is the lack of controller support. Please had this to make the experience great!",Positive,201,39
Jake Harris,2020-10-14 06:14:21,Love the game for its story and atmosphere. But I would LOVE to see gamepad support for phone and tablet play. I really really like the game but having to use the touchscreen to play is really bugging me.,Positive,204,39
Kaira,2020-09-29 02:01:02,I'm having so much fun playing so far! My only complaint/concern is that the game over heats my phone and there seems to be no setting that won't do that. My thumb feels funny because of the heat from the phone lol.,Positive,215,42
Beginner Art,2020-10-11 23:22:46,"It's really good, I just encountered some crashes understandably cause my phone is just about low end to mid range phone. I just wish you could find some solution so even the mid range and few low end devices could play this majestic game.",Positive,239,44
Joshua Jordan,2020-10-17 14:32:34,It's fun and I really enjoy the game. But I would love it if they let me use a different account on my PlayStation 4 and be able to switch accounts on that system because I much more enjoy playing on my big screen TV rather than on my phone.,Positive,241,50
Justin Ni√±o Suganob,2020-10-05 20:16:30,"The game is great. The storyline, controls, graphics, everything is good. But please fix some lags and optimize the game to make it run smoother. Will change my rating if I see improvements.",Positive,190,33
Cezar Rotariu,2020-10-02 05:12:12,"The game is ok, the commands are more designed for mouse and keyboard or a controller. That said It's pretty impressive for a mobile game. Still some frame drops here and there, but it's normal",Positive,193,35
Rokiah Abdullah,2020-11-11 14:51:28,the game is great but there is some bug at domains etc. Another issue that other player have is resin. its cost too much resin (to collect materials) and the resin's cool down take too long,Positive,189,36
Dharmateja Guthula,2020-10-27 19:03:06,Mihoyo should have atleast released the game with complete Liyue region story. Now we have to wait for drip feed updates for remaining Liyue story chapter. Hopefully when next region is released the complete story is available instead of waiting months for new story content.,Positive,275,45
The holy plank,2020-09-29 12:36:40,"It's a fascinating game, but for some reason when I play the game after 5-10 minutes of playing it lags really bad. I'm using a Moto g7 power and it lags really bad. Is there anyway to fix it or am I stuck.",Positive,206,43
RockZ Bantolo,2020-10-13 15:37:45,I will make it 5 star if this was an offline game instead of online i love everything except that it was online in a solo journey of an open world. I think this game would be really consider as offline not online. Online for coop and online purchase.,Positive,250,49

Francis John Carranza,2020-10-01 21:35:47,It needs some touchscreen icons that can change its position anywhere on the screen & save it.. I have some difficulty controlling this current controls.. Compare to the other controls.. They have the edge because they can easily change/assign buttons..,Positive,253,40
maricel Reyes,2020-10-23 14:25:01,"The game kept on kicking me out, I don't know what to do about it, if it's alright can you guys fix it? It's been troublesome since I can't continue to do my missions with it or even do some errands. It would be a great help! If it would be fixed in the future!",Positive,261,55
Lauren Sohaney,2020-10-13 10:35:39,"Super fun gameplay, beautiful graphics. The gacha rates are REAL bad, but luckily the free characters are really good. Controls on mobile can be kind of wonky so I'm really looking forward to the Switch version in the future.",Positive,225,39
Esther Choe,2020-10-01 22:25:17,"This game is great, but, why add a stamina bar and not have a mount function in an open world? Running is a chore and climbing makes me want to run my head into a brick wall. Please give me a pony to ride.",Positive,205,44
Adam Dermawan,2020-10-08 12:01:02,"This is really a great RPG game, the graphics is nice and the gameplay also.

Terry Jerrett,2020-10-05 07:39:44,"Great game, only issue I have is that there is no controller support on mobile, this would make it so much better to play while I am not at home and on the go. Play it on pc with controller.",Positive,190,40
Cameron Findley,2020-10-11 23:32:59,"Pretty good game, looks amazing, fun BOTW-esque gameplay with gacha elements. Would be 5 stars if the rates weren't absolute garbage and weapons weren't in the gacha pool but hopefully they'll change it after enough feedback. Definitely worth trying out.",Positive,254,40
Trizzia Calanno,2020-09-29 03:12:48,I'm having fun with it so far! The story pretty good and I love exploring the world so far! However I keep getting disconnected from the server and there's a bit of a lag when picking up items otherwise it's pretty fun.,Positive,219,42
Raivis M≈´rmanis,2020-10-06 17:18:40,"Game is beautiful, story is engaging and combat is good enough for mobile. But the deal breaker is the stuttering cutscenes and skipped animations. S10e phone and game settings say 'smooth play' but that ain't it when it's another cutscene... ;(",Positive,245,41
James Stubbs,2020-10-03 14:43:49,"Great graphics and game play, but why is dealing and receiving damaged tied to the server? I don't always have a perfect signal or wifi so damage lags behind the actual combat. That really detracts from another wise good mobile game.",Positive,233,41
mary ann zapatero,2020-10-11 22:50:27,"Its great and all, but the game always kicks me out for about 10-15 mins or even 2-3 mins of the game. I hope you fix this. But its a great game everyone should play...tho please fix the issue for my fellow phone users too.",Positive,223,45
Dylan Conekin,2020-10-11 00:13:19,"The game is beautiful, feels great, and is amazing in general, but my phone barely meets requirements and struggles with the load this game can put out, especially when it's starting to heat up",Positive,193,34
Praneil Mukkamala,2020-09-30 22:47:39,"I have a phone with a Snapdragon 755, and while it runs fine for the most part, it eats through battery like crazy. It even lags time to time. It really needs to be optimized for it to run well.",Positive,194,40
Aden Chai,2020-10-09 17:19:53,"The game is nice. But the tree and tall grass alway block my sight when in the battle. And sight camera alway auto turn to a different sight which also block by the higher land surface. Adjusted the setting for camera, but not much improve.",Positive,240,45
ciprian diola,2020-09-30 03:24:13,"Video cut scene's lags base on my experience, i am using Xiaomi's Redmi Note 7, cutscenes hooks you up to the storyline, such ashame that it lags, i hope it will get fix in the future updates and more hardware friendly on middle range phones.",Positive,242,45
Rena Amamiya,2020-11-13 01:53:17,"Even with 4 gb ram and lowest setting, the visual and lag is too annoying ;; i'm sorry but I'll giving 5 star when myself able to play this game xD",Positive,147,31
Tee Kok Yew,2020-10-04 11:50:24,Amazing game in both graphics and gameplay. Also the developer is very kind which make the game not pay to win. The downside 1) PS4 not allow cross save. 2) Cannot restart the story or change main character especially in PS4 system.,Positive,232,42
Vergel Bautista,2020-10-07 19:33:08,"Awesome game, slightly awkward controls but thats to be expected on a mobile game. The geaphics are awesome but it sooms its too good that my phone is struggling. Maybe a bit of optimization? I'm sure the devs can do it like they did honkai impact",Positive,247,46
M0e Jo3,2020-10-01 21:29:52,"So far such a great game. The graphics are beautiful, the controls are easy. The only thing I will complain about is the drop rate of characters, maybe make it a little bit easier and your game would be great.",Positive,209,40
Cody Wilson,2020-09-30 03:34:03,"This game is great. I've played for about an hour and a half and lost track of time. The camera is a bit wonky. My biggest complaint is there is no controller compatibility. If that gets added, then I will give 5 stars.",Positive,219,43
Banana Jones,2020-10-27 09:25:49,"I love this game! But the problem is that i havent this game for weeks and i have to log in again. But when i was in the loading screen, it frozed. So please tell me what to do. I wanted to play this game again",Positive,210,46
Bong Rudi,2020-10-11 15:03:59,"Really bring a new experience in mobile gaming... But to be clear, this game is not MMORPG.... So you be play alone almost all the time, but they have content that you can play co-op with your friends.",Positive,201,38
Luis,2020-10-04 07:58:22,"It's a great game, very in-depth. They don't force force you to buy things. You can get far and not buy anything. I just wish it had co troller support. Pc version has controller support but notobile version?",Positive,208,38
Ricardo Alves,2020-09-29 12:03:20,"This game has superb graphics, good gameplay and design, but still needs some optimization and refinement, and I would love to see it running more smoothly later on, when they update the game",Positive,191,33
Justan Cox,2020-10-25 01:49:17,It would get a solid 5 outta 5 but for the first few weeks the game ran perfect but then there were a bunch of server issues I've been kicked off and a few other issues with still having full internet connection,Positive,211,42
Nevik Blade,2020-10-05 03:13:26,Its a good game but its kinda let down because you need internet connection to play and its the same as Honkai Impact where you dont have main class to play with just buying heroes from gacha boxes(this is probably why its online) would be great if this can be played Offline,Positive,275,52
Rokudokishi,2020-10-03 09:37:34,"The game is great! but it REALLY needs optimization especially for RAM usage...Always reload the game when switching to other apps (which makes really hard to mulititask while playing it). 60 fps so far so good, but can be improved~",Positive,232,40
Fardhan Rafshanzani,2020-09-29 22:36:56,"The game is really really really great!!! by story or the gameplay is amazing. Unfortunately this game is pretty heavy for every average smartphone these day.

VAlhalla Sky,2020-10-30 01:00:35,"What makes this game so popular and successful is it actually meets our standards as a mobile game.

We shouldn't celebrate this, as it should be a standard, but we absolutely should recognize its accomplishments.",Positive,322,52

Nuh Aiman,2020-10-12 16:12:24,"I hope this game will be offline.. if there, need to be online.. I think that should be the menu, gacha systems, equipment and else.. because, at my hometown, the ping sometimes reach 999m/s.. its hard to play.. please accept my request..",Positive,238,42
James Binder,2020-10-11 12:31:35,"Overall a great game so far. A little laggy even tho I am on a galaxy note 9... I feel like its using a little too much power to run but with the settings tuned for my phone, it runs fine. 4 out of 5 stars is a fine rating!",Positive,223,50
Ivan Matkoviƒá,2020-10-05 04:06:12,Great game but i don't like CO-OP restrictions. I played with my friend and after we kill the boss only he gets a loot and it would be cool when we explore that other players can activate (unlock) teleport shrines on their own world.,Positive,233,44

ZorenSosa,2020-10-20 15:01:54,its a great game especially to be F2p. only thing i would want to see changed is the character rate to be increased for summons and to increase the summoning currency for us f2p players so we can do summons abit more,Positive,216,42
Robby Alexander,2020-10-05 19:01:16,"Overall this game is really good. The only thing that must be fixed in the future is the Optimization. I play this game with Helio G90T CPU with 8gb RAM, I got Lowest Graphic Settings with <25 fps. Thanks for the Good MMO Developers.",Positive,233,44
Patrick Lagua,2020-09-30 18:59:27,"Almost a 5 star, very fun so far BUT it needs a dodge option instead of just run, jump and attack. Also make the option to use a bluetooth controller available so it's easier to move the camera around while fighting.",Positive,216,41

iTimi,2020-10-06 00:25:29,"This game is cool, but it could do with some more optimising, for cutscenes and gameplay in general, my phone is capable of running it, but i think it could run it better if it was more optimised(samsung galaxy A50)",Positive,215,40
Aiden Baumgartner,2020-10-11 04:00:06,I enjoy this game a whole lot theres tons to do and the graphics are off the charts for a Mobile game. The only situation I have is that there aren't outfits/skins for characters so you can change your appearance. . .,Positive,217,42

Torenticus,2020-09-27 18:19:07,"After playing the Chinese open beta, I can say its pretty fun. Synergizing teams is cool and the world is gorgeous. However the gacha experience is overall bad.

Miguel Del Rosario,2020-10-07 18:40:23,"Love the game but there's an issue with linking your phone to your PC, everytime I try to link my email it keeps saying email already exists. Please fix this, I'd really like to continue this on my PC.",Positive,201,39

naimur rahman,2020-09-28 14:31:23,It's good but too demanding even for a mid range phone. And there's occasional glitches in some cutscenes where the audio of the game continues but the scene doesn't. The two dragon cut scenes would such an example.,Positive,215,38

Eragon Wesker,2020-10-04 02:30:28,"Great game. Still playing through it right now, but that isn't stopping me. All I have issues with right now is the battery consumption for mobile. Otherwise, it's much worth a try to play!",Positive,189,34

Jasminne not important,2020-10-13 06:42:03,"Really good game lore, I'm a sucker for that stuff. I also love how open world it is, my only issue is how many times my game has to reconnect to the server ‡≤†Ôπè‡≤† other than that it runs great!",Positive,191,40

Alois McMahon,2020-10-13 15:21:42,"Camera cutting into grass and trees during fights is pretty annoying and the glide not working half the time makes certain fights impossible, but other than that great game. Also we should be able to pet the dogs.",Positive,213,38

ZOMBIE DAMIEN,2020-10-11 22:04:21,"Second account because there's just lack of progression once you hit AR30 and higher, the grind becomes slow because a lot of it is behind the resin wall and we don't get enough so made a second account to do more stuff and take my time while the main does it's daily stuff",Positive,273,53
Tri Sulistyono,2020-10-01 12:25:59,"indeed this heavy game. I tried it on the Pocophone F2 Pro Snapdragon 865, it can only be smooth at 30fps, high graphics and low others. I wish it could be at 60fps, high graphics without overclocking the device to overheat.",Positive,224,41
Brandon Scott,2020-10-12 04:34:19,This game has been really fun. Adding a character customization feature would give it a 5 for me. Being able to change appearance and clothing/armor availabilities I feel would give it more likable depth.,Positive,204,34
Daryl Nicolas,2020-09-29 23:12:30,"The game is addicting, and there's a lot of things that you can do. My only problem is 1. The camera sensitivity of Y axis (up and down), please have a separate sensitivity to it.",Positive,179,35
Saffronite,2020-10-12 22:20:42,"Honestly so far the game has been nothing but EXTRAORDINARY, the only thing is i wish there were servers in which u could pvp with others and higher chances for 4 and 5 star characters, switching servers while keeping progress is good too.",Positive,239,43

Jeremy Mathew,2020-09-29 19:57:12,Really fun game! Love the open world and story. One issue would probably be the pull rates in the game. Had to grind close to an hour to do a 10 pull only to get 3 star weapons and no characters.,Positive,195,41

Freddy Couger,2020-10-04 23:11:28,"Really great game overall although the frame rate drop sometimes, i really doesn't mind. My only issues are the game keep reconnecting even with good connection and the game keep freezing in the middle of the cutscene then crash",Positive,228,39

jayson fallan,2020-10-14 23:17:01,Game is almost perfect but I hate that it is too focused on playing alone. Co-op contents are not worth the time. Adding PVP or maybe a PVP Ladder system will make players more engaged.,Positive,185,35

shawn nelson,2020-10-09 04:08:53,looks good for a mobile game I will say some of the mechanics and art style feel ripped out of Zelda breath of the wild but not completely more like inspired by breath of the wild I haven't played it for very long but can see myself getting into this game,Positive,255,51

Josh B,2020-09-30 16:14:06,"It seems like a really promising game, the rates are abysmal buti haven't felt like the top stuff is a must have atm in the story. Pulling for units and weapons in a shared pool however is a bit scummy",Positive,201,40
Logan Hanlon,2020-10-07 10:41:06,Really enjoying this game but there's crackling audio in the android version which is a bit annoying. Other than that though I'm having a great time!,Positive,149,26

TroLLoloLoLo,2020-10-12 15:02:22,"I was sceptic in the beginning, even when people said it was a ""Asian"" Legend of Zelda (like Zelda isn't from Asian KEKW) but to be honest. This game actually gave me some hope for the RPG/CoopRPG/OnlineRPG genre. And to top it of it is a gatcha game like no other. Characters you use with different Elemental abilities and nice fighting style. AND a HUGE Open world which I've neeeever seen in a mobile game. I really grown fond of this game. Feels like it actually is worth to grind for Characters.",Positive,500,92
Domini Francesco Juan,2020-10-07 23:46:52,"Very well made and decent optimisation, overall experience comparable to Breath of the Wild with its charm and graphic style, but needs more graphics options for lower end devices and more in depth control options",Positive,213,35
Louigie Caday,2020-10-10 15:56:36,"It's a good game with a good story and graphics, but now the game always freezes. I don't know if it's my cellphone or your game has a problem. Please fix it:)",Positive,159,32

Syafiq Ikhwan,2020-10-23 05:59:53,It was amazing game but you need to give more reward raid a domains and make replenish original resin faster. I'm tired of waiting for original resin to replenish.i hope you can do something about it.THANK YOU,Positive,209,37
Jesus Acosta,2020-09-30 06:43:14,"It's pretty good so far, the combat can be a bit repetitive, but it makes up for that with diverse characters, and 's just fun imo",Positive,130,26
Shaw Lamontagne,2020-10-12 21:39:43,"I'd give this 5 star, but the lack of controller support takes it away. Without controller support, I'm not inclined to play it as often.",Positive,137,25

mitch martin,2020-10-05 16:59:15,Game is great. However I find the controls a little hard. Maybe I'm just not use to this type of game on my phone. I find fighting multiple enemies with a bow very hard trying to kit enemies while charging and shooting. Still a great game though.,Positive,246,47

For a south east asia like me, I am doubting where should I start my main account and so I choose the Asia server. But why it's lagging so hard? I played Amber the archer and whenever I charge the arrow, the screen'll shake so much that I miss my shoot. But when I played in the latter server, it's smooth as silk. The game is great but I'm gonna give it 4 star for this.",Positive,466,94
kian avehuro,2020-10-10 12:18:54,I hope you improve co-op mode so that the player joining would also be able to get rewards from elite bosses so that it would be beneficial to join than just to help out without getting anything from helping.,Positive,208,39

SALMAN Onfroy,2020-11-11 06:59:22,"So far in the game I have been lucky enough to pull some really good characters. My main problem with the game is how extremely grindy it is, you grind to ascend characters, grind to rise in rank, grind to level up weapons and characters and if your f2p, grind for Mora and primogems which you don't get a lot of further into the game. The pull rates are gruesome and if your not lucky enough to pull the best character and weapon you can't get very far in events like spiral abyss and harder domain",Positive,499,96

It's absolutely soul-crushing spending all that time collecting primogen, just to have some useless lv3 swords and a horrible lv4 sword. And this happened to me 3 times, 3 TIMES. Also the prices are stupidly high. It's simply not worth paying that much money only to get some dumb swords that you are gonna throw away eventually.",Positive,485,86

William Harvey,2020-10-26 11:21:44,"I love this game and how everything is so clean and smooth. It's definitely worth playing with an asterisk. Playing on phone is more hindering and is definitely NOT how to play it. The phone screen is too too small to really enjoy the visuals, and the controls leave much to be desired for that platform. I think I want gonna move to PC and that will be how I play",Positive,364,71

Preetam Ghosh,2020-10-26 09:41:21,"Stunning visuals and soundtrack. Should play on a pc to have the best experience. It runs on my phone pretty well but it drains way too much battery, can't complain as the graphics is top notch. The story quests are really nice and the gameplay has a lot of similarities to LoZ:Botw but still is quite unique in its own way. There is bit of problem rising from the very limited amount of resins (in game material) which stops progression beyond a certain point per day. Still I enjoyed this a lot.",Positive,497,92
Shawn Livingstone,2020-10-26 09:34:37,"This game is super fun until adventure level 30, then you have nothing else happening. (No story missions, no God missions either). Barely any world missions too. Nothing to do the chests don't respawn either, so your left with an empty land that you pick flowers from with a high level (other than the daily missions and resin spending) Yeah its fun at the beginning but need to add wat more stories and missions for people with higher levels. Otherwise no point in playing after s certain level.",Positive,497,88

Leveling up my characters has been the only goal to work towards in this game because the story just has too much exposition and you have to level up in order to progress anyways. The issue is, though, every time I gain strength, my enemies do as well and it just feels like going back to square one over and over again.

Daniel Unto,2020-10-23 11:50:37,The game is great. Storyline is amazing. Graphics is outstanding. Minor issues and bugs but that's okay for a new game.

Firezz Zonia,2020-10-18 23:13:07,It's a really great game overall but I'd love to see customizable controls or controller support and better gyro controls. The gyro in this game is wack. Hopefully we can cross save with PS4 soon as well. Maybe by adding our PSN account to mobile.,Positive,247,45

Lady Ki,2020-10-18 14:28:09,"I absolutely love this game! Overall, the graphics, the plot, the character motives are there. I just wish for two things: 1) Please be more generous with prismogems! Probably you could stretch it to 8-10 from 5 in common whereabouts, or at least make prismogems easier to find. 2) Can leveling up (especially for world ranks 2+) be easier?

Wei Ren Teh,2020-11-10 14:28:51,"Candidate for Game of the Year, honestly. It's not that any of the mechanics, gameplay, story, or art is new...but what Mihoyo has done is combine them all into a wonderful experience that is free to play. My advice, don't rush the game. There's plenty of content coming, but for those of us who got caught in launch hype, we're stuck grinding endlessly right now.",Positive,364,65
Winter 135,2020-11-12 23:16:11,"(Spoiler alert!)I must say it's a very good game, but now I'm having difficulties. I don't mind the lag, but when using the bow, I can't move the sight meaning i must get out of the aiming stance and change my line of view. And for the dragon, it somewhat glitched out and blocked my view. It probably because of my current device since I don't see anyone else is having this issues. Still a good game with a wide area to explore. I just hope this get fixed since I'm now stuck at the dragon fight :p",Positive,500,98
Deme Dull,2020-11-11 06:55:34,"If you love to explore and get lost in a world this game is for you. The graphics are beautiful along with the soundtrack. One of the very few games that is so much more enjoyable with the sound up. This game is very open world. You can explore, solve puzzles, look for ore, cook, gather plants, farm monsters for materials and so much more. There are daily tasks to accomplish IF you want to. I cant say enough about this game. I absolutely love it.",Positive,450,86
Rowena Spinks,2020-11-11 20:18:53,"This game has blown me away. Its gameplay rivals some console games and it's possible to enjoy the experience fully without spending anything (at least so far for me). I've had so much fun exploring the world, honing my characters and challenging my combat abilities. As a regular mobile gamer, it's been a hugely refreshing experience compared to some of the P2P dross. If you want a 'proper' open world combat game, this is for you.",Positive,434,76
med ben,2020-11-11 07:09:07,"This maybe one of the best games i ever played, the graphics, controls and everything, however.. i wish there was more content in the game, more quests, and more accessibility to other characters to try them out and have more fun.. (the cost of upgrading everyone is just not possible) and i wish there was a messaging system with other players without going into co-op mode",Positive,374,66
Lor Naethan,2020-11-11 07:08:55,"I've played several RPGs, Gachas, open-world RPGs but this is the one I can say the best one so far. Every random NPC has super unique, beautiful and tragic stories to tell. The side quests stories is also beautiful and well written and has a lot of life values to tell. The main story is super great! You're like watching an anime while adventuring in that world at the same time. Height systems, elemental reaction system, etc! This game has a lot of unique features.",Positive,469,85
Fire Fox,2020-11-12 11:24:58,"This game is remarkable. The controls are easy and every thing works. From hunting to cool to just overall fighting. If you like rps which I know I do saying this game was made for you is an understatement. The AI do pretty much anything the player does from move to talk to read! And I mean it, the npcs talk about every thing, the weather, the food they even introduce themselves. Now I could go on and on but genuinely is a really really really good game and you should down load it.",Positive,486,94
Sin,2020-11-11 14:42:31,"This game is so good it's hard to put into words. There are just these moments when you grind and fight monsters, solve puzzles, and climb mountains to grab offerings, only to finding yourself looking out at the most amazing view with the most breathtaking relaxing music playing at the end. I get chills just thinking about it, Genshin Impact just hits different.",Positive,364,63
Ravensteal,2020-11-11 14:08:45,"So far it's been a blast. Not only has it got a pretty decent story but also some amazing views. The graphics can be scaled to fit your needs whether you need to turn it down a little for smoother combat or set it to the max to optimise a great view. This game gets updates constantly with new characters story and quests to explore. As I said before, it's something new and refreshing for me compared to the endless swarm of FPS games recently",Positive,444,85
Nathaniel de la Rosa,2020-11-12 08:29:29,"Most probably the best open-world RPG game that you could ever find on mobile right now. The game looks too stunning tbh, I'm amazed that it's even free. Though I'd love to clock my rating down to 4 stars due to the terrible gacha rate and soon-to-be-updated storyline, it's just ridiculous to give 4 stars to a game I've spent hours playing with my friends and enjoying it a lot at the same time. With that being said, 5 stars, hands down to the number 1 on my game tier list.",Positive,477,91
Shiela Pangilinan,2020-11-11 07:35:01,"This game is breathtaking, i was really surprised when the wait was over and started playing, for people with high end phones you can really feel the game and enjoy the graphics. For rpg lovers, that is not mmo related, but the co op is a nice touch tho, this is for you, also add to the fact that the game is not a type of pay to win, hence it is friendly for F2P players like me. Overall so far having a great experience playing this game. Keep up the good job mihoyo! Thanks for bringing GI.",Positive,494,98
Julian Quintero,2020-11-10 10:44:44,"For a free-to-play game you're getting a huge amount of actually really good gameplay, putting aside the gacha system which you definitely should investigate a little before getting into the game it is beautiful, interesting enough and depending if you stay on your phone or change to PC or console challenging enough as well. It does have problems after several hours of gameplay in terms of what you can do, but, if you're a casual player you won't even notice them. Do give it a try.",Positive,486,86
Jose Mari,2020-11-11 06:57:48,"The game is well rounded, the fighting system is fun, the elemental abilities are fun, the story is good, I'm not a big fan of cutesy girly characters but this won't inhibit me from enjoying the game, I like grinding and leveling up different things, and you don't have to spend money on the game if you manage things right, my only complaint would be that there's a big lag on the item pick up which forces you to stop for a moment to pick up items from the floor and the lack of manly characters",Positive,497,96
ChyouRose,2020-11-11 09:35:02,"Seriously awesome! I am a sucker for these anime inspired adventure games. Sadly my pc is trash but it works ok on my phone. The only problem I have is the lack of controller support. I was suprised to find out that my phone controller didnt connect, it seemed like the game that would have it. Sucks that my fingers are in the way of the beautiful graphics. I hope in new updates they will include it.",Positive,402,77
Yukina Kazumii,2020-11-11 14:08:41,"This game is just some of the best out there. Just perfection in all sense. Good graphics, Beautiful characters, And a rich storyline. As an F2P player, there may be some aspects in the game where you actually have to pay real money like the other BP pass, Or just whaling for gacha. Even people had some complaints about how the gameplay is just boring and empty once you made it to the ""end"". But that's just because they aren't focusing on the adventure aspect. So, I recommend playing it cool~",Positive,497,91
Yu He,2020-11-11 10:08:56,"Probably the best in the last few years. I used to be a WOW player for 6 years, then switched to some other games from time to time, but this one caught my eyes, i have been playing this for over a month now, i will continue to play for a long time, it has lots of details and beautiful views, the upgrading system is awesome too, the characters, equipments, skills.",Positive,366,71
Allan Reyes,2020-11-11 14:18:24,"Very entertaining to play with. A must have game in your phone or pc. Great exploration, mind bulging side quests and superb storyline. I really like the concept of the game. Just one thing im facing difficulties is the camera view on phone, bushes and trees can block your view. The game is full of dodging, camera rotating and fetching your loot in the ocean from a 10, 000 ft mountain top. Full of surprises and its nice that you are given the privilege to play solo, not depending on parties.",Positive,496,91
Edwin Banchs,2020-11-11 08:10:23,"Overall this is one of the best games I played on my phone. Visual n audio is great. Story line doesn't bore you. So many side quests, you will be busy for hrs. Im actually surprised that this game didn't cost anything and happy that you dont have to spend money in game to enjoy the game. I only wish that there was more to do with multi player.",Positive,346,69
vishal reddy,2020-11-11 08:56:27,"This is mind blowing game in my life .I ever played a open world game in mobile phone .This is my first game .The most favorite thing for me is switch between the elements .The negative point for me is ghat just taking so much time download at beginning and it take some charging more than normal , just a little bit more that's all .Now it's my favorite game",Positive,359,70
_.billy dillol._,2020-11-11 05:07:43,This game is just amazing. I started playing because I was bored and wanted a new game to play and I'm seriously addicted. The details of the game are really beautiful and it also runs at 60fps. I'm genuinely impressed by the though put into the game. I just wish the english dialogues were recorded accordingly to the character movements. Otherwise this game has a huge amount of potential.,Positive,391,69
Mohamed Azzam,2020-11-11 09:26:50,"I just love the fact that this is a full console game thats working perfectly on my midrange A70! The game itself is awesome, immersive and detailed. Combat system is great but could use some refinement. The only thing that's a little bit annoying is how the camera moves around on it's own during a fight.. since I'm only using a touch screen not a joystic, it's hard to keep adjusting the camera mid-fight.",Positive,408,74
Ingeet Pal,2020-11-13 14:36:04,"Saying ""Absolutely wonderful game"", ""beautiful graphics"" and ""nice gameplay"" would be undermining this game. It's much more than just that. The fact that the developers could put in such great graphics using such a low amount of space (comparatively) os astonishing. This is the best game I have played in quite a while",Positive,319,53
Laura Bronson,2020-11-14 08:21:14,"I play this on both phone and PC. Really fantastic open world game. Very similar to Zelda. Beautiful graphics and interesting characters and enjoyable combat system/gameplay. Its more difficult to play on phone than on PC. The only downside is that while the game is fully cross-play, it is not fully cross-save. This means I cannot log in and play my phone/PC account on my PS4. I hope when the game is released on Nintendo Switch that the cross-save feature is available.",Positive,473,82
Pretzel,2020-11-11 17:02:26,"please, do not download this game at all cost. you will perish over the fact that this game has great and amazing graphics and models. you will suffer over the hands of mihoyo and simp for the characters they made. you will fall in love with this game to the point of no return. i had a friend who downloaded this game once, ever since then she never stopped playing this stupidly awesome game. the controls, graphics, and gameplay is nuts. genshin will take over and ruin your life. would recommend.",Positive,500,91
Alex Ng,2020-11-11 23:04:32,"Fun to play and time consuming. The open world is actually extremely large to explore. The combination of different elements can form various tactics. So far, don't reckon need to spend money as those items can be gained throughout the gameplay. Yet, you can spend a bit to support this company, they do make good mobile games :))",Positive,330,58
Ben Kramer,2020-11-16 01:50:17,"I love this game! Every aspect of the story and gameplay is amazing! I do have one minor concern though: I play with the male character, and when Paimon and other characters use pronouns for my character, they use ""she/her"" instead, as if I'm the female twin. In the story section under ""Profile"" in the character menu, it also refers to my twin (sister) as a he when describing her reflection on Dvalin's eyes. Could this be fixed please? I know it's not intentional, but I do feel a bit misgendered",Positive,500,91
Dion Ardhitia,2020-11-14 08:11:52,"This game man. Just astonishing. This game is basically the mobile game that i've been waiting to come in years. The stories are broad and well thought out, the gameplay is smooth and the controls are easy to memorize and easy to use, and the graphics. Dont even get me started on the graphics. Easily the best graphics in all of mobile game. Overall, i've been playing the game ever since the game come out and has no plans to stop playing. Thank you so much for the game and keep up the good worküëç",Positive,499,95
Amjad Shujau,2020-11-11 10:36:47,"It's pretty good. So far one of the best open world mobile game. Great job, for all the people who worked hard to make it.. Hoping for awesome updates. Also please add push to talk or team chat option, while in co-op mode. Messaging is a little tricky. Also the time for replenishing just 1 resin is takes a bit of time.",Positive,320,62
Justin White,2020-11-11 04:58:46,"How is this game free? This is by far the greatest, largest open world rpg on mobile. It's so large in fact that it's also on PS4 as a full fledged title. All of that is here on mobile in a game that honestly surprises in how ginormous it is. I've played about 24 hours of this and I'm just now passing the prologue, but the game doesn't feel like it's slowing down at all. In fact, it feels like they're ready to add HUGE updates just based on the current map (which I haven't even completed yet)",Positive,497,98
Joshua Williams,2020-11-11 07:18:03,One of the best put together games I've seen mobile or otherwise. The story is intricate. The game requires you to be smart about it. Using reactions between elements rather than just weaknesses to amplify damage. The only improvement I would say would be to multi-player it feels hard to get into and there is little or no interaction,Positive,335,59
Shawn Marran,2020-11-11 20:05:52,"To be honest, I first installed this on PC just to see what all the hype was about. After playing it for a few weeks, I must say I'm impressed. The game runs smooth, the storyline and gameplay is exciting. The co-op works seamlessly cross platform, you won't even know whether you are playing with someone on a phone or PC. If you need to hit the road, just log in to your account on your mobile and continue exactly where you left off on PC. I have so much more to say, but no space left. Go try it!",Positive,500,100
Jesi M.,2020-11-11 09:21:41,"Offering a unique flavor with the usual free-to-play gacha model, Genshin Impact has plenty of points to hit on when talking about what it does well. Exploration, combat, aesthetic, load times, and even cross-platform play all come together to form the core of Genshin Impact. These qualities are polished and while they are straightforward and simple, it is also easy to pick up and put down whenever. Definitely worth a try.",Positive,426,71
Jessica Buckman,2020-11-11 10:38:06,"A beautiful landscape complete with an enticing plotline and charming characters. I've sunk so many hours into this game, its hard to put down. Genuinely the only downside to the game is that there's no real means of acquiring specific characters that you're interested in, aside from a money sink and/or praying for luck. The gacha element is merciless, but the free characters you get along the way are still worth playing for.",Positive,429,73
Tsukishima Rin,2020-11-12 05:31:31,"This is the first game that im addicted to. Usually im not so into this type of game because im too lazy to level up the character etc. But this game, makes me thinks otherwise. Yes you can spend money on the game but u dont have to, because u can just get it from doing quests and be patient. The only thing that is hard is probably during wishing, when ure trying to get a new character, but thats what makes it fun. Overall i would say this game is so fun and im always excited to log in every day",Positive,500,102
Random Videos,2020-11-13 08:36:17,"Great game, great graphics, great story, great combat features, great overall game! This is a game of the decade for me! Even the odds of 5s characters are low, i still have fun using my 4s party. And the open world with coop is the best thing about this game with my friends! Keep up the good work mihoyo! PS: though i am a pc player, please develop a LITE version of this app for mobile users. The game is very heavy for low spec mobiles. A Lite version could solve this just like PUBG Lite.",Positive,493,96
Andy Hoang,2020-11-13 23:02:34,"Such a beautiful game! The artwork, musics, and especially the settings within the world map, I can easily immerse myself into this fantasy world as I play the game. The fighting mechanics is brilliant, as it involves elemental features. As of now, the only complaint I have for this game is that it doesn't have PVP mode.",Positive,322,57
Christine Wang,2020-11-11 17:03:37,"This is the first ever MMORPG game that actually have the great gameplay and everything. I like how you can actually experience the open world gaming/story, unlike other MMORPG where you just stay in the battlefield screen and fight others move on and repeat. This is the type of MMORPG I love. If I really have to list a complain about this game, is the update waiting times. Other than that I got nothing to complain.",Positive,419,76
Tiger P,2020-11-14 03:00:32,"I love this game. It's great that miHoYo made an open-world game for smartphones. This game is easy to understand and play, but you enjoy it a lot. There is a lot of playable characters who has different abilities. Interesting events. Huge world with surprises. I recommend this game. But make sure you have enough space on your device - this game needs a lot.",Positive,360,65
Stephen Wright,2020-11-11 17:13:03,"A great mobile ARPG, even for F2P users. The open world takes elements from modern greats like Breath of the Wild, but manages to be more than just a ""clone"". I enjoyed many hours solo, and with friends. Genshin is a really solid modern JRPG experience. If you have a spending/gambling addiction, and aren't used to games with ""gacha"" elements, be cautious. I personally purchase about $5-$10 worth of in-app purchases per month, slightly less than I've spent on other live service games or MMO's.",Positive,497,85
Monica Rejante,2020-11-11 09:00:08,"First time to play online RPG because I saw the graphics while my partner was playing, and I did not regret it at all. The game is so interesting that you cant resist to explore more. One thing that makes me regret downloading though is playing this online for like 12hrs a day (no joke, but multitasking sometimes hahaha). I really enjoy spending time to explore more chests, challenges and appreciate the view of places I go to!! üíóüíóüíó",Positive,435,79
Joshua Hogg,2020-11-14 07:25:42,"This game is awesome. It looks beautiful and is oddly interesting. What really shocked me was the fact that there are very few actual microtransactions, I can literally play this all day(I have) not spend any money and feel like I progressed just as much as a triple A rpg that I payed for. I played up until you could customize you're wing glider then I realised it was also on the ps4 abs I started playing on the ps4(I prefer the controls). I would recommend this game to almost anyone.",Positive,489,91
Noel Zamora,2020-11-15 00:23:51,"From a console gamer, This game is simple yet amazing. I didn't spend money on it but it game me a Five Star character!!!! Qiqi is so cute and fun to playüòÜ. I don't know why but maybe I just got lucky, because other say that drop rate of five star character are bad but I'm happy that I got one very early in game, also graphics and art style are amazing even at lowest settings. I actually fell bad for buying a new phone just for this game. Gameplay wise the elements are fun to mix and match.",Positive,495,99
Umar Ashraf,2020-11-09 16:04:38,"The game is superb! The storyline is intriguing, the graphics, characters and the open world, all are top notch. Also there are lots of little secrets that makes the game more enjoyable. Edit: The only problem in the game(as mentioned by others too)is the wish system. You need to use it 90 times just to get a 5 star character. Plz decrease this to around 35 to 40 because it's hard for us 'Free to Play' players.Also the oceanid boss is also pretty hard and there are bugs. Love the mechanics too.",Positive,499,92
K Dog,2020-11-01 06:55:05,"It is rare for a mobile game to really get me hooked, but this thing is nuts. The graphics, scope, open world. The only thing I might change os the story could do with a bit of work. But aside from that it gets five stars just because I can't put the thing down. Very well done, highly recommend this game, especially if you are into Anime, RPG and Zelda type games. Now back to it.",Positive,382,76
Felicia Kasinda,2020-11-03 11:44:32,"This game is so amazing. The first thing that i like about this game is there is no auto-quest / auto-finder. You need to walk to the quest by yourself and that's really good for me because it's an open world game, so you MUST explore the world and find a lot of chest, quest. The graphics is perfect even with lowest. But i think it's a little bit too heavy when a cutscene is occur. Anything beside that is perfect! Anyway, can you add a feature to pet a dog please? That will make this game perfek",Positive,500,98
Kristine Hare,2020-11-12 07:58:11,This game is super awesome!!!...and this is the kind of game that I've been looking for...I love how you make it and with the stories as well!!!...I tried kinds of games like these but eventually I got tired of it because some of them doesn't make any sense and Also bothered by all of the instructions which is a lot!...But in this game its a masterpiece!...It is well arrange and can easily feel the game!!!...its was like your in the game itself!!!...I love this game so much its my new obsession!,Positive,500,91
Andreas Depe,2020-11-07 08:46:13,"The open map details are very awesome. From killing monsters, getting ingredients, even shooting birds to get its meat, and also gliding through the awesome sceneries. The characters also have their own unique skill that can be used on the world map as well as the dungeons. The story seem to be pretty good so far. I think the only one that's missing is how we can make this an open world for players. But anyway, with the current set it's already impressive for me and worth for 5 stars.",Positive,489,90
Â§©Èü≥„Åø„Åã amane mika,2020-11-01 15:23:49,"A really good game! The graphics are beautiful and the storyline is really well written as well. Starting from the character designs to the villages and areas, they're all amazingly designed. The controls are easy too. Gameplay is fun and easy, a really nice game to either chill or fight monsters. It's probably the most entertaining and the best rpg games I've played till now. I'm not an rpg master, but this game has so much story to it, it's really amazing.",Positive,462,82
Ashlyn Irwin,2020-10-30 02:13:38,"Insanely Amazing, the game takes you on a wonderful storyline that never seems to end. The animation is great, and the different parts of each characters personality are amazing. You can play with friends or alone, and the monsters are crazy complex in their designs. The best part... ITS NOT A PAY TO WIN! Yes there are in app purchases but it's not so important that you have to buy them. Developers, if you see this, thank you. I've played this amazing game for far too much time already. :)",Positive,494,90
A Google user,2020-11-11 06:27:01,"Great game, open world with lovely views but be careful not to throw too much money at it. Got it on my note and ps4. Unfortunately you cant link the two but can visit other worlds (after a bit of grinding) if needed. Multiplayer opens up after you reach a certain adventure rank. Not much u can do in multi as of yet. Looking forward to the updates but will stick with f2p on my accounts and advise you do the same unless u have loads of disposable income being it a bit like gambling.",Positive,486,95

I'm just soooo in love with this game!",Positive,392,78
Robert Blackwood,2020-11-11 15:50:14,"Listen the gacha may be a bit rougher, but the quality of the game is incredibly high, and every patch there are more characters you can get without paying in. Given that it can be played (better) on pc as well with the same account, it'd honestly be my favorite of the year if everything came as part of a 60$ game. Still phenomenal even with the gacha elements.",Positive,363,69
Evyxed II,2020-11-11 15:02:56,"For a mobile game, this is remarkable, a large, seemless open world with enjoyable movement, in depth combat mechanics with an elemental system beyond just bonus damage, and along with that it's a full RPG with side quests, dungeons, side activities. Not to mention that the a game is stunning visually Truly a remarkable game, and you can run it on such weak device, it truly shows the talent of the devs and i hope they keep this game going for a long time.",Positive,459,84
DrakeWurrum,2020-11-11 08:02:27,"Honestly the best gacha game I've ever played. But don't even worry about the gacha. You really only need 8 characters total to do everything possible, and you get so many free Primogems and special events that its impossible not to have at least that many. Resources for leveling and gearing your characters are so hard to come by that it really isn't wise to worry about anybody past your main 8 for a long time.",Positive,414,76
Shirley Liu,2020-11-11 08:44:18,"You can tell a lot of love (and money) went into the game. The graphics are gorgeous and there are surprisingly deep storylines, even in the side characters. If you've seen a trailer, then go ahead and expect that level of detail in the actual game. Aim controls can be a little tricky on mobile and sometimes sound quality might dip a bit during action sequences (I'm using a Galaxy S10), but otherwise good gameplay. Highly recommend!",Positive,436,77
George wilson,2020-11-15 05:08:54,"Best game to date, hands down GOAT for F2P. Interactions with the environment seems endless, always finding new ways to get around the huge map, there's many different combinations for elemental damage as well while battling, makes for an interesting combat experience.. Progression rate of the characters lvl is quite easy and straight forward, and steady.. no road block's so far. The dialogue is insane, as well as the animation, definitely worth playing!!",Positive,459,73
Tawni Mouse_official,2020-11-11 13:46:13,"This app is amazing! I have recommended this game to 3 friends, one who I was able to convince her to get it. She started playing and she enjoyed it but at the start she said ""this game is okay but I only like one charecter."" So I told her to just wait and she got Qiqi and other charecters like xingqui and when she had to leave her dads house she said ""I WANNA GO BACK AND PLAY IT"" . She also was amazed that the graphics were so good and she asked how it was free! I agree it's a awesome app!",Positive,495,104
Raymond Jay Sy,2020-11-11 15:43:59,"I've played a lot of mobile RPG games but this one really stands above the rest. The story is very engaging, and most characters have depth in them. The gameplay is great and can be challenging on higher levels. The open world aspect is just so massive. The atmosphere, you can just loose yourself in this world. The gacha system is okay for me, you can finish the game using F2P characters, you just need to master different elemental combinations. Having a 5 Star is just a bonus and not a must.",Positive,497,92
Awsome Sauce,2020-11-12 03:20:50,"I'm playing from mobile, cut scenes can be a little choppy sometimes, and it throws you off when audio keeps going, but video has paused, you have to restart the app to know where the story is going, its been smooth so far though, controls are snappy, graphics are tight, and FPS transition smoothly while playing and the heat issue has been resolved since my initial installment hopefully thre new update doesn't reset that, otherwise playing this game is awsome!!! It's like console play in my hand",Positive,500,87

Pivot Kouhei,2020-11-16 02:18:49,"Don't spend money unless there is a Character Banner for someone you absolutely want. F2P is the best way to experience this game, it's way more fun playing without paying for Gacha, only thing I can recommend spending on is Battlepass and/or Blessing. Avoid summoning unless there's an element or role (Dps, Healer, Support) you need, research (use google) the character you want and your team, and figure out what you need before you use your gems.",Positive,450,77
Mochx,2020-11-10 15:40:10,"This game is great, not perfect but not bad either. I personally use a mid end phone, and it surprised me that it runs as well as it does on my laptop. I have been 0laying for about 2 hours per day, and I have been progressing through the game with enjoyment, it engages you to do more, but the stamina problem is real.

Â•àÁ∑íÁæé,2020-10-29 17:33:08,"This is my first time playing a battle RPG game, moreso an open world one. I wanted to expand my experience and I must say, this is worth every last space it took in my storage. Considering that it's a F2P game, it really is worth it. There's a gacha function, but it's not like you need the best characters to enjoy the game (which is shallow coming from me since I already have 2 5* without spending any money). But they're generous enough with free rolls. It's worth your time, I can assure you.",Positive,498,95
Matt Mitchell,2020-11-08 07:36:20,"This is fantastic game. Yes you can spend money, but you don't need to. You can do and get anything in the game just by playing. The graphics are great and combat is really good. Exploration is fun. The only negative i have for this game is can get difficult to play on a phone. But, you can also play on ps4 or pc. I have switched to the ps4 and it seems better to me. I hope this will be released on the ps5 when it comes out.",Positive,428,89
Todd Simonson,2020-11-11 06:49:43,"People always have something negative to say, ""they should do this"", ""they should t have done this"" but you know what, it's just a game. A beautiful RPG which which is exciting, unique and a ton of fun. All games must have some aspect of monetization, because otherwise studios and amazing designers wouldn't build products like this one. You can play this game completely free or pay for extra things, like anything else. It's amazing, all you can do without paying a cent. 10/10 game of the year.",Positive,498,88
Kanipan,2020-11-11 08:08:53,"It's fun, but the gacha rates are kinda low if you're rolling on the banners with real money so keep that in mind.

Also, i found the map is bugged out like my player is moving but the minimap isn't lol. So yeah, new updates, new bugs i guess and graphics is more demanding imo which makes it a lot harder for mid range phones to play anymore.

The thing that disappointed me is the co-op feat cause you're only limited to just farming elite monsters, ley line blossoms and domains, i would love to do world and story quest with friends and i hope we could talk to NPCs during co-op, but overall its a AMAZING game its a one of a kind especially in mobile.",Positive,493,95
–î–∞–Ω–∏—ç–ª –ö–∞–ª–¥—ç—Ä–æ–Ω,2020-11-02 12:12:21,"Incredible open world game with an immense amount of adventuring and missions; with, what i imagine, a HUGE amount of adventuring to come. Recommended if you like games like Fall Out, Zelda: BotW, pok√©mon (due to the elemental side of the game, not capturing monsters.) For developers: + please don't worry about Resin right now. Game is perfect. People complaining obviously doesn't know about character development in an incomplete game. LEAVE RESIN SYSTEM ALONE. +we need control button arrangemen",Positive,500,79
Amanz Galzor,2020-11-02 10:14:19,"awesome experience, a must play game for all the rpg, and adventure fans. strongly inspired by zelda breath of wild but improved and different in lots of mechanics. the graphics are absolutely stunning, u will not find any other game that even comes close to it. Its a gacha game but not pay2win, u can go full free2play and still enjoy as much as anyone else.",Positive,360,66
Nick Zhang,2020-11-08 12:01:05,"I really like the exploration and all the random things you can find as well as the wild puzzles though I had to find guides for some. The bosses are pretty challenging and the progression is decent. The only problem is the gacha which makes getting decent characters so hard. There should be a quest for some characters and gacha should just be early unlock, weapons, and constellations.",Positive,388,68
Baljit Thind,2020-11-08 11:50:58,"Its an am game! Though the ""tasks"" can be hard to figure out but it makes the game more fun! Not to mention the amazing graphics and character designs. The plot is really well written. I do wish they put more for the female protagonist then the males one. But over all you should really check it out!",Positive,300,58
ItzCedric,2020-11-09 12:48:27,The game is amazing! Its story is very good and the graphics are flawless for an anime lovet like me lol. My only problem is the overheating even at medium graphics but atleast the gameplay is great. But my biggest problem has to be the quests. I need to grind for hours just to get another story quest and my adventure rank barely goes up. So please add more story quests for adventure ranks.,Positive,393,74
F√°bio Can√°rio,2020-11-10 18:17:14,"I do end up playing this game 99% of the time on my Windows computer, but having the choice to login on one platform or the other alone, whenever it's convenient, makes it such a wonderful experience. This game is clearly inspired on BotW when it comes to visuals and climbing mechanics, however the fighting mechanics are a lot more fun and much, much deeper! Elemental reactions, lots of gear to boost different status, changing between 4 characters on the fly to come up with some crazy tactics, amazing and enticing story line with interesting characters. The pity system ensures you can always get new characters even if you're just a F2P player. You can get away with also only investing around 30 minutes a day in the game if you're a busy person and get all the most crucial stuff done. And did I mention you can cross-play with Windows, and PS4 players? It's just such a pleasant experience to group up with 3 friends and explore the world, no matter where they choose to play. As long as they're from the same server\region at least. The fact that your character is stuck to the server you've created it in is my only real major complaint.",Positive,1149,207
Ferli Aulia,2020-11-11 07:47:00,"Good graphics. Great game mechanic. Many things to do. Cool cross platform, you can play this in pc or phone and can even play together with ps4 users. Easy to change account, and many more exciting features and adventures! Tho, i just hope the resin regeneration is more generous. 1 per 8 mnt is too much. Makes it 5 at least.",Positive,327,61

Awesome characters and a fleshed out world.",Positive,469,89
Gabriel Yong,2020-11-11 10:43:59,"Simply AWESOME. Interactive open world, unique skills, character back stories, switching of playable characters mid battle for strategic gains, and definitely not a pay-to-win game.

Blake Caranto,2020-11-14 22:40:18,"I appreciate that this game is cross platform. Playing it on both pc and Android. Controls are good for both. Love the story, exploration and love the characters.

SparkTDS,2020-11-14 01:15:01,"I absolutely love this game! I used to have a problem with FPS and performance because my phone is a potato but now I can play much smoother at 30 FPS. The gameplay is really great and I love all the new things they added in the new update. Getting the characters you want is pretty hard but the whole game can be enjoyed free to play and I love the combat system and the huge open world, overall a very good game and I will definitely be recommending it to my friends and you should defo try it out",Positive,499,100
eric manago,2020-11-05 06:37:49,"People complain there's not enough content or its too hard to level up.

Its Fiz,2020-11-11 09:53:04,"The quality of the game is really amazing as so as the story i dont know how you guys came up with places of the name and more and I also really like the detail of the places like in liyue there's a water passage way, I think this game doesn't deserve to be free tbh but I'm glad it is(or else I cant play it) overall this game is golden.",Positive,338,71
Quinten De Vos,2020-10-30 04:24:06,"This mobile game is actually fun to me, which happens less and less the longer time goes on. The endgame gets a bit stale but the first couple of hours is the best experience I've had on a phone and the story bits unlocked after every couple levels serve quite well as a break from the daily grind you eventually get into",Positive,321,62
Hans Hermawan,2020-11-11 09:42:30,"Great artworks especially if you love anime or Zelda BOTW ( the gameplay similar too but not exactly the same ), Greatest voice acting in mobile game I've ever heard ( I only try English and Japan Dub Version ), Real free roam style adventure. The gacha system are addictive and can be frustating. The grinding are enjoyable if you are patient enough, PvE main content with no PvP so far, there is little reason to rush. Being F2P only mean slower progress but fair enough.",Positive,473,86
Osisms oasis,2020-11-01 15:00:58,"Its one of the most best games I ever played! But I think my enemies are too powerful for me to handle but there is one time I beat a boss at level 42 and my character level is 25 simply used strategy for that,and that boss is no other than the electrick cube thing and I after I beat all the quest Im facing right now are so hard for me to deal with but I wish I could be more easy on baloon thing quest So far the best games right now!

Genikka Mai Bermido-Legaspi,2020-11-01 18:59:00,Really good game even though it just released! There's tons of things to do after AR30 and before. There's so many mysterious things that just lure me into the game more the puzzles challenge me to think sometimes and I enjoy that. I watched the 1.1 update stream and I'm so excited for the new system and characters!,Positive,317,58
Dandy D' Lodi,2020-10-30 01:11:34,"Amazing real time combat mechanic, though a bit clunky and restricted has good start and room for improvements. Top tier as free to play, not good if you have gambling addiction since most of the gear and all of the character are through gacha, a welfare system to address lack of support characters should be added. Hope future patch would address it, aside from resin problems.",Positive,379,66
chi b k,2020-11-11 08:18:38,"I've never kept a game for long and have no plans of removing it. It is incredible, from the open world exploration to the NPC's own dialogues and the secrets in the game. I have very little patience and have been quite pessimistic about applications and/or games but this hit it off the park. This is amazing I totally recommend it to everyone who wants a good story, action, exploration, fantastic art and graphics and just over all fun. I love it, thank you so much",Positive,468,86
Vernon Gloria,2020-11-02 20:18:54,"Voice and animation clips are great. A good non auto rpg that players can explore the world and gain good items. My only issue is that when you aim a target with a bow, it is somewhat hard to center a target. Takes time to aim due to difficulty to control even if I set up the sensitivity option. Same as to run and walk. I hope their is a mini shortcut that enables to run/walk without overdoing the controls. Other than that,it is a great game. Thanks for bringing it up.",Positive,473,92
Davin Ali,2020-10-28 22:39:38,"This game has been my routine. Started slow but as it builds up I get into the game more and more everyday. It's open-world concept is absolutely what sold me to this game. Sure it looks inspired from a certain already successful game on console, but there are different things compared to that game that makes this itself something on its own. The monetization is balanced, meaning one is not necessarily need to pay in cash to explore and experience the game. I look forward to more updates üôèüëè",Positive,495,89
Creative Caramel Pancake,2020-11-08 18:51:04,"To start, this game is amazing! It's very detailed, and the visual affects, absolutely stunning! The characters have unique looks and elemental attacks. It's really fun to play. Though the GB requirement is pretty high, It's worth it! It's really great in terms of gameplay. An RPG game combined with gacha mechanincs, is really a new style to me. The first few mins. Into this game, I was amazed by the detailed surrounding me. If you haven't yet, I reccomend downloading this game.",Positive,483,83
Roy Lotan,2020-11-11 05:52:34,"The game is absolutely amazing. Graphics, gameplay and everything else- marvels.

Only downside- heats up the phone, adviced to play while not connected to power, but battery at hand. Even with that not a battery eater!",Positive,328,60
greentea,2020-11-09 22:17:10,"fun and looks beautiful. one issue i have is that the cut scenes lag so badly that they don't play at all, and the game lags a tiny bit too. however i do use an older android phone so that's likely the reason why. it's got tons of entertainment in it, especially for a free game! i'd definitely recommend this to people, as it's super addictive.",Positive,345,66
Jayson Quisquis,2020-11-09 15:34:52,"Everything was good. I appreciate the very high quality graphics and the storyline. If you're looking for an adventure type game that takes months if not years to discover them all, then I would highly recommend this for you. Suggestions to the developers: Apart from the co-op feature, please make a World Tower, just like the concept with 'Sword Art Online'. It can be solely for multiplayer, with convincing leaderboards and to take on dungeons with friends with some bosses each floor.",Positive,489,82
tomye,2020-11-11 11:13:46,"Great game. The game satisfies u with good rewards after playing a while. The gacha system in the game is very impressive as well. The animations too.

You can play for hours without dropping a single cent. A lot can be earned via just playing. Quite surprised at how generous they are too. Obtained a few 10 rolls just by playing normally and barely even see what's in the premium store.,Positive,372,73
Ethan Tucker,2020-11-11 23:46:02,"Ok, this game is a must!!! The beautiful graphics and scenery, added with great story and gameplay make this (in my opinion) the best mobile RPG ever! This game has kept me in for hours on end. Fighting and doing quests has never been so much fun in a game, each with their own little story. To top that off, the customer and feedback service is quick and easy. You file an issue, than in about a day they get your problem fixed like that. So don't hesitate, press that download button!!!",Positive,488,92
Azazel Blackwing,2020-11-10 14:54:21,"Very fun game to play but the resin system needs to be fixed, if you could improve the production rate of the resin and turn in into 1 resin per 5 minutes that would be great, it would be nice to decrease the amount of resin needed for dungeons, elite bosses and world bosses too! How about slashing the resin required in half. World bosses will be 30 primogems, elite bosses will be 20 primogems and the domains will be 10 primogems",Positive,433,82
Hank Indie Games,2020-11-12 08:07:47,"Fun and aesthetically pleasing looter RPG. Top quality for a mobile game. Good graphics, great music and voice acting (try the other spoken languages!), fun combat, good story once you get into the meat of it. Go slow, do the side content, explore the map, if you try to rush the main story you'll hit grindwalls. Only negative is that characters come from loot boxes with absurdly low drop rates. Try not to get hung up on that, just play the game for what it is and you don't have to spend money.",Positive,498,93
little taco,2020-11-12 15:49:27,"I love the game, it's a good 5 stars. I played the first week and a half, but what sucks is that it's on every gaming platform except Xbox.

Avion Gaze,2020-10-28 13:50:53,"""Free"" open world roaming game, inspired mainly by Breath of the Wild and bits of Nier Automata. I've definitely spent way too much time on this game, but that's mostly because I roam a lot to get stuff that are scattered across the regions. Gacha aspect is optional, because the main thing you need to focus on is your weapons, talents and artifacts. Getting better characters only means you have a bit of an easier time and thats it. Highly suggested you play on PC client for a better experience.",Positive,499,90
Hanging Sayori,2020-11-09 11:49:21,"Probably the best game I downloaded this year. Thank you for making this game! It really feels like this game will be start of something new in mobile gaming.

I hope this can be implemented ASAP as I really want to play this game to its fullest.",Positive,403,74
Francis Cleo Galon,2020-11-11 06:25:05,"It's the most beautiful RPG game I've played on android, and though the world kinda feels barren because it's so big with not a lot of activity, I assume this is a performance decision because it doesn't run consistently on 60 fps on my LG V30. My only gripe so far is that there's a lot of exposition in quest dialogs, it feels too much at times. There's a ton of stuff to find wherever you go and it doesn't have the tediousness of travelling a large expanse that usually comes with open worlds.",Positive,497,94
Daniel Martinez,2020-11-04 13:14:45,"This is a great gacha game. With the ability to play it on both PC and Mobile, I end up playing it a ton! While the controls are way easier on the PC, mobile is doable. Some of my friends may have mixed experiences on mobile but they all like PC. Just doing free to play, I have been able to get a pretty good team and don't feel like I NEED to buy anything to advance.

Stuart Mokler,2020-11-07 09:48:32,"This is a beautiful, well made and immersive single player game. I've been playing for a few days so far; exploring the world and interacting with countless objects, people and places and kicking some enemy hide. The adventure level, which is seperate from character level, stunts your growth somewhat, forcing you slow down and enjoy every aspect before moving up a tier.

Still, i will give 5 stars for being the first top free and open world game for mobile phon",Positive,500,93
Felice Pepe,2020-11-02 22:42:00,"Very nice game. It is a complete RPG experience with 3D wide world exploration, nice music, real-time action fights, several playable characters, a lot of no-player-character to interact for side quest, colorful and playful atmosphere, and it is free to play (you can spend money to obtain more respurces, and to TRY to obtain more characters, but it is not needed). The only ""not-so-great"" point for me is the character design of the playable characters that look like very similar each other.",Positive,494,82

Zhen Thach,2020-10-31 15:40:45,"Phenomenal graphics and designs with compelling stories and lore. The gameplay is really fun and the elemental reactions system makes the combat stand out from other RPGs. There's plenty of stuff to do in the game for free, and you can progress through the game with just the characters the game gives you for free. The only glaring issue I have is how little endgame content there is and how sparse events are. Everything before AR40 is a good time though and the best thing is it's free.",Positive,489,88
Cjxtreme66,2020-11-05 00:09:17,"This is a stellar game that can be played without spending a dime. With that being said, if you did find yourself wanting to spend, I suggest the blessings pack that gets you daily in-game currency. You can get tons of currency just by exploring and quests, so take in the sights. I'd say most of the map can be explored even before you are high level, but take care to avoid strong enemies. Finding the elemental oculi takes a while but is well worth the boost to stamina and rewards earlier on.",Positive,496,93
Yannick Ferreira de sousa,2020-11-02 20:26:25,"At first I tried to prove this game was yet another pay to play game to a friend, but after a few hours I've been proven wrong. I actually spend some money on it to support it as this game is so well designed and totally free. This masterpiece is a perfect mix between three of my favourite RPGs: Grandia, Suikoden, and Zelda, it absorbs the essence of these games incredibly. I am just mindblown by it, and if I could give a sixth star I would. They just made the next big thing in the RPG gaming!",Positive,498,98
Blitzboy73,2020-11-04 02:39:03,"Art style is definitely close to breath of the wild but make no mistake, this game is completely different. Unique gacha style which doesn't force you to have the latest OP character. An open world full of random puzzles and monsters. It will get repetitive but not in a you'll get bored kinda way. Combat is straight forward with a few tactic elements thrown in for more hardcore gamers. Story so far is pretty good and it leaves room for players to make up the missing parts. A great game so far.",Positive,498,92
Felix Doberenz,2020-11-02 01:37:27,"Ode to a whale - I came, I pulled, I wept. What a great single player & coop experience. Just be prepared to gacha if you get hooked. And remember gacha is gambling. So I would not advise anyone under 18 yrs to pick this up. Yes, it is technically F2P but you need a lot of self-control to stick to that. Otherwise, definitely worth your time. I'm still playing at AR 45+ & waiting for first major content patch on 11/11/20.",Positive,424,82
ninu ninu,2020-10-29 14:58:50,"Open world doesn't mean it's mmorpg, this game is like zelda botw and skyrim, but you can play with other people too if you want. This game doesn't have pvp right now, so i suggest just enjoy play the game with character you have, unless you attracted to certain character, and now the worst part of this game, of course it's the gacha rate, if you play fgo you know what gacha hell looks like, this game looks like that but the dupes is more useful in this game than fgo + this game has pity system",Positive,499,97
Malcolm Phua,2020-11-08 21:46:40,"The experience so far in Genshin Impact has been absolutely amazing. The game feels like a mix of Honkai Impact 3rd and Zelda Breath Of The Wild. I play both mobile and computer versions and I reccommend playing on both, as computer version is the superior, but mobile allows you to play on the go. If you love open world games, do not hesitate to play! The music and gameplay, characters as well as story and exploration are as great as everyone says it is. Give it a fair shot and you'll love it!",Positive,498,94

Ten Vee kie,2020-10-31 22:10:57,"The game is fantastically rich in detail and I've yet to get sick of climbing up everything and jumping off to glide long distances. The only problem so far is that the archery controls are really awkward to use outside of puzzles, at least on mobile platforms. Hitting anything is maddening if you need to move, aim, charge the attack and then hit a rapidly moving target.",Positive,373,67
Ultra Gamer,2020-11-12 22:32:45,"It's the newest best game I've ever played!

Wahyu ƒêivayana,2020-11-06 21:09:54,"The game that I have been waiting for a long time has finally been released and when I played for the first time, the graphics were the best for Android games, the story was interesting, and the gacha mechanism was quite easy to get 4 star characters and etc. But I've been playing for a month but haven't got 5 star characters or items. I hope to update more interesting things. Good luck developer!!",Positive,401,74
Austin Pachano,2020-11-08 11:55:30,"This is actually a lot of fun, the story is interesting, game play is solid, and graphics are great.

gerry ismail,2020-11-02 15:46:40,"Amazing experience from the very first day. Great animation, very good character design, and an interesting storyline that keeps me hooked.

Milcazzz,2020-11-03 14:14:35,"This game is amazing. Even though that it's still in production with updates and stuff, it's still an amazing game.

The graphics are good and smooth, the controls are easy and simple, and the world around it is beautiful, and I love the character's designs as well.",Positive,368,67
Crazy KooK,2020-11-01 03:46:37,"I love it really truly ‚ù§ On mobile, the controls can get a little tricky when trying to attack and control aim/camera direction. I admire the graphics/details while traveling around the map freely (not jumping between way points) there isn't much if any buffering/lag to load in the changing environment. I like how it introduces the monsters we encounter, but I do wish there was a record book that logs them, especially for ones that you don't see often. This way we can reread their descriptions.",Positive,499,86

Lex Javier,2020-11-11 07:36:08,"Gacha can be addictive and can ruin lives. Drugs are cheaper is the joke, but it's true. Unless you're a millionaire and thousands of dollars mean nothing to you, play as much as possible without spending - delay spiral abyss higher floors if you feel like it's impossible to achieve without buying gems for 5* characters and resin refills.

Yestin Inlong,2020-11-11 03:02:06,"One of the most fun gaming experience I've had.

A lot of people have brought this up so I won't explain it but really, the rates are incredibly low and 2, please please add selling!

The graphics are beautiful, gameplay is excellent, and the controls are witty and smart. I would like to know why one 10 draw is worth $25. I would spend more money on this game if I felt like I was getting more for it. I think a lot of people would.",Positive,480,94

Brandon Joerges,2020-11-02 12:02:12,"Beyond my expectations. Music, visuals, voice acting, gameplay, stories, lore, all for free still blows my mind.

M P,2020-11-04 09:56:49,Genshin is a great game if you take the time to be smart with your resources and plan correctly. A lot of people complaining probably aren't doing that and are spreading their resources thin between every character they have. I stuck with my core 4 characters from AR 1-40 and I haven't had any issues with gameplay difficulty. Graphics are great! I love that it's a cross platform game that I can play on my PC or phone when I'm on the go. I'm looking forward to future content updates. :),Positive,490,91
Wyatt Leo,2020-11-09 22:14:52,"Masterclass free game , excellent background ost music, extremely high attention to details, 10/10 graphics and vast and expanding world for us to explore and venture in. How if I were to criticise anything, it would definitely be the unpredictable lag that this game has at times, I believe due to it having a large file size. If possible, fixing it would definitely make the game 11/10. Getting characters we want without cashing is also a very slow process since it is a gacha game.",Positive,485,85
Genevieve Pilon,2020-11-07 08:33:06,"This game is phenomenal!! The game style is very much like Skyrim. Graphics are breath taking, story is extraordinary.

You will find yourself in battle and your character will auto climb a little barrel or you will start hanging on to a wall. The weapon attacks aren't player interruptable.

Screvo,2020-11-02 01:27:27,"Great game ! Graphics are amazing and this game lacks nothing compared to its PC/Console counterpart. It's just that sometimes the climbing/swimming mechanics feel clunky and unrealistic. Apart from that nothing to complain about ! I'm sure this game will continue to evolve and will give us more and more events/quests to pour hours into. You've done a great job Mihoyo, keep up the awesome work !",Positive,398,67
Glen Lester Chiong,2020-11-05 22:24:44,"The game is really immersive. There are plenty of things to do. Issues that I've encountered are that the game is still not Macbook compatible. I fear the day that my phone will no longer support the game due to the need of high rendering speed and most of my gadgets are at least 3-5 years old already so the software is a bit old. But overall, I would definitely recommend it.",Positive,378,72
jan michael Fernandez,2020-11-01 20:23:07,"so far i haven't seen any pay to win schemes. the game is definitely a fun rpg to play. graphics are really good, the gameplay is also really good. one of the best RPGs I've played so far. Already at level 10 for my party and other games would be popping up packages for sale but not this one. although I'm happy the game isn't pay to win, I sure hope the developers of this game make huge money so they could continue making good games like this.",Positive,447,88
ramadhani sudrajat,2020-10-29 20:01:35,"I just can't believe that this game is made for phone AND all other platforms to play together with friends! This is definitely game changer and would obviously be the trend of many other games to ever gonna be created or developed later on. Graphics are awesome, in fact its a little bit too much for standard phones. Control is a little bit overwhelming but still manageable. Gameplay is the best at this moment, where you can do many things in other game you might only dream of.",Positive,482,88
MyLO 06,2020-11-10 07:26:13,"An open world rpg has always been my cup of tea. Haven't tried anything so far in my mobile, but decided to give Genshin Impact a try. So far, except for some lag issues on my part, maybe because of my device, there isn't really anything that I'm mad about. Thank you so much for this game, and keep up the good work everyone.",Positive,326,64
Ang Christopher,2020-11-11 06:59:13,"Currently the game is great, good open world that you can only find in AAA games. OST's great, combat feels fresh. Although there are some flaws for now, the game is still in it's infancy state. There is a lot of potential in this as it slowly expands it's game.",Positive,262,50
Jax Smith,2020-11-10 21:38:35,I love this game!! I have it on pc and mobile and I think it's great that you can switch between both. I don't know what kind of magic they used to make it t be able to run on phones but it still looks great and the whole map it still the same. The only thing that I don't like is not having the option to make your own controls but the layout they use is alright just saying it would be nice to be able to use a 4 finger grip. I know the game just came out so I'm excited to see all the updates.,Positive,496,108
Gijan Climaco,2020-11-11 06:37:21,"The game is really good. It gets harder by the time you increase your World level. It's toxic player free since it revolves on your own world but you can play with friends in Co-Op mode. A lot of improvements will come, I do hope there are quests accessible only for Co-Op mode as it would take the game to another whole level. Really balanced game. You can go Free to play if you want but you can also spend to make things easier.",Positive,431,84
Rondepart,2020-11-09 22:02:42,"Superb game, good story, great characters, abysmal gacha rate is compensated by the fact that free charcters are enough to clear most of the content (and the pity system). Really just good stuff, though I siggest u play on pc as its just a much better experience. Highly recommended. Tip: Don't look at tier lists, as it may ruin ur outlook towards low rated characters, as ive said u can clear most of the content with the free characters.",Positive,440,79
I Like Bread,2020-11-12 07:14:18,"This game is absolutely astonishing. I was in awe, of the VA's, the world building, the overall of the game. To think that a video game can fit right in your pocket is cool enough, let alone being able to run smoothly on my phone. You nailed this one, MiHoYo.",Positive,259,50
Beatrice Lee,2020-11-11 09:23:55,"Love the game. Exploring places and hunting chests. How character fight with monster and everything. The game is great just that sometimes the game will reconnecting to the server few times. Sometimes it was in the middle of fighting monster. Overall is very nice. Targeting Zhongli, here I come.",Positive,296,49
Chuah Shu Thai,2020-11-11 09:08:47,"I havent played any mmorpg game for a long time but I really enjoyed the graphics, animations in the fight, the various combo to do in a 4-man team, the story (including life lessons haha), and it's relatively much less grindy to upgrade your chars if you plan carefully, really worth to continue playing as a f2p myself",Positive,320,58
James Dorr,2020-11-13 02:09:57,Really fun game everything is going well since I just started playing. My only hope is that there will be a little more spawn rates for monsters or even boss monsters in certain areas also having the ability to connect a console controller to my mobile device. Definitely a game I found worth investing some time in.,Positive,316,57
Auren Athena,2020-11-11 14:10:55,"I absolutely love this game. The graphicsüëå, it's easy enough to understand and so detailed that you feel a part of their world.

Andres Uscategui,2020-11-12 13:29:18,For a free to play game this is an amazing experience and immidietly draws you i. With everything it has to offer. As a long term game the pay to win mechanics are problematic but they do offer enough in game alternatives to grind your way through eventually if you have several years of free time on your hand.,Positive,311,59
6R360RY,2020-11-14 13:09:40,"This is a fun and great game and filled with a lot of things to do with great music, graphics and gameplay, but there's still a lot of bugs and it lags a lot too which sometimes annoy me and ended up getting me killed so I hope they would fix it soon but other than that it is a very good game",Positive,293,63
Ledan Playz,2020-11-12 15:59:59,This game is really interesting and imaginative for all fantasy lovers. As per I saw the 1 star rate comments most of them are crash reports but in my device it's absolutely fine! But for them who can't play this dope game I feel sad. So please fix the crash issue. Nobody can't stay off if they play this game...,Positive,313,60

Soft n Flffy,2020-11-07 21:17:15,"Recently I've been having good pings. This game is a must-download. Its a very well made game. Should buff the resin system for the lategame.

Sean Sanchez,2020-11-01 20:37:01,"I absolutely love this game, free roam, so many quests, though I just wish that getting to wish a 10x, would be a bit cheaper, because having the same characters for more than 2 weeks, almoat makes me get kinda bored, though all over the game ia ao fun, I hope for the next update to have more characters, lesser currency for a wish, and possibly an upgrade to graphics.",Positive,370,70
Berserker Road,2020-10-30 12:33:26,"Its a good game and is d best free to play game i ever played.

Jelly Mikami,2020-11-04 12:39:05,"At first i expected this to be a cheap clone. But this actually has super deep lore, unique battle mechanics, some gacha elements, interesting multiplayer, fun events, and an amazing world design. Talking to mundane npcs has got me in tears. All their stories are amazing. All i can say is wow.",Positive,294,52
Stany Anna Victor Jr Debaere,2020-11-07 13:46:14,"It's a very amazing game, but just a few bugs and there since the game is just new so hoping and waiting for future updates and more amazing features the Dev's are waiting to place. As well as, is there any chance that I can log in at your website using a Gmail account? Since at the start of the game I accidentally used my gmail account instead of the website's account.",Positive,372,72
Machi Meep,2020-11-05 06:25:53,"This game is such a wonderful experience. Both visually and audio are just perfection. I'm so excited to see the next updates. Co-op is a joy, just exploring the world with my friends doing dumb stuff. But even then the solo play is astounding. The story is so beautifully put together and the voice acting is just the best. I really have to commend the game devs on this one",Positive,375,70
Benedict Escatron,2020-11-04 23:10:17,"It's very very good! The animations, the skills, voice overs and the story too.

Kishor L.U,2020-10-29 08:03:37,Best ever mobile game I have ever played in my life time.....best part is cross platform save in pc and mobile.....I have even played it in my ps4pro it's awesome in that too......but I play mostly in pc and mobile due to cross save platform it has .......but forcing player to play the story mode to play multiplayer is kinda harsh though......,Positive,345,62
Lovec Quine Hunterstorm,2020-11-08 08:54:23,"I only review few games, bc I don't play most ""games"" more then once for few minutes. But I can firmly recommend Genshin as it is amazing open world rpg that you can play without money investment of any kind. Elemental reaction mechanic is interesting and nicely done mechanic and it's open world mechanics are rewarding for walking, searching and not taking a beaten path. Story is decent, nothing truly bad, but nothing to write home about. Overhaul I recommend this game.",Positive,474,82
Ray Vortex,2020-11-09 08:51:32,"After a month plus of playing, all I could say about this game is that, it's amazing. Astonishingly gorgeous, the play style is smooth and unique, the characters are different, and have their own stories and quests. The background music was just heavenly, truly a breathtaking experience when you explore throughout this vast wonders. Not to mention the graphics, the design and art style of the game. Not much of a pay to win in a case most RPG games do. Definitely deserves a 5 star!",Positive,485,86

Juni Post,2020-11-09 23:05:47,This is pretty much the greatest game that you're ever going to play on your phone. It looks like and plays like a AAA quality game made by Nintendo (Yes the breath of the wild comparisons do exist for a reason. ) You really can't go wrong playing this game it is fun and it is utterly jaw-dropping in how good it looks and how well it controls. Also it's cross functionality so you can play it on your phone or on your PC without having to use a different account. Which is awesome! Grab and go!,Positive,496,97
Pritish Saha,2020-11-13 17:35:12,This game has got a damn good graphics. The co op mode can be made better like guilds can be introduced with guild tournaments where PvP will be available. And Co ops where progress will be made in both players account. And if the size becomes the problem then the storyline once completed can be made optional to be kept,Positive,321,60
Ken Lorico,2020-11-07 05:37:38,"The best gacha game I played since Fate/Grand Order and Arknights. Fully Open World with RPG elements that make you feel like you are playing a Triple-A game and the gacha aspect of the game has low rates but the currency used for it can be easily grinded. Co-op is alright and could use some improvements though. Nonetheless, this game sets the bar high for future Free-to-Play games and Gacha games. Highly recommended.",Positive,421,73
River,2020-10-29 19:39:10,"The game is so cute and cool. I love the stories that come with every adventure.

The first 20-30 hours or so you will lose yourself in this game while exploring the world finishing quests. Loving this game can't wait for 1.1, there are big plans for this game and can see this lasting for years! Playing mostly on PC and having the entire same exact game on mobile is amazing, we'll have to keep our eyes on this concept.",Positive,417,77
Makoto Kurosu,2020-11-03 05:49:06,"Everything is awesome! In term of gameplay,the character designs, exploring the open world and this game is not boring like other open world game in mobile. I love how the game is not rushing the players and we can play with our own tempo. Just if you could lower your price for primogems and the percentage for rate up 5-star characters and weapons, and make Gnostic Hymn battle pass more interesting, i would love to invest more on this game.",Positive,444,80
Zeldonyx Skypotter,2020-11-05 23:47:14,"This is my new favorite game!

hassaan syed,2020-11-10 00:00:05,Honestly one of the best open world RPG games one mobile. The graphics and detail is amazing.

Paint,2020-11-11 08:10:39,"This is my favorite game right now! You can tell the devs have spent a lot of time on this game and thought out (nearly) everything. There are tons of hidden chests, tough monsters, and a well-balanced economy that isn't pay to win! This quality of game makes me feel guilty to play for free because of the hard work put into it, and I rarely discover a gem like this.",Positive,368,71
Dafder D,2020-11-13 22:09:05,"This game is so good, almost like HI3rd, in order to make it better, i will write down some suggestions. Pls make us can play the archon and story quest that we already completed, because some of us are wanting to replay again the quest. Then added a battle animation on air like HI3rd : APHO, because jump in APHO is innovative of mobile game, so pls added it to genshin impact.

Dennis Mirra,2020-11-11 16:22:58,"A good open world fantasy game with multiple characters to control. Game gives out several essential characters for free and you gotta gatcha draw others. You make a party it of 4 characters, so game let's you have a full team for free. Also different events give you a currency to try your luck with drawing more. There is no auto play or idle gaming, no pvp, do pay to win is non-existant. Controls could use some refinement though (let us redefine buttons on pc version on gamepad)",Positive,484,88

Tshering Ngedup Thobchog,2020-11-05 17:21:09,Great game. Please respawn the mob chest in game at least once per week. I have opened almost all chests and the whole map is a barren land now. All I can do is complete commissions and gather mints. Also please reduce the time required to replenish resins. It takes like 16 hours to fully replenish it (120 resins) and only four to five minutes to spend them all in farming artifacts and talents. What company wants players to spend less time in their own game? This is ridiculous. Overall it's best,Positive,500,92
KringusKrang,2020-11-03 16:05:46,"I have waited for a game like this to exist for 8 years, gameplay, style, characters, are all 10/10! This is what all other ""Triple A"" mobile games should base their standards off of. This is the only mobile game I can recommend to anyone.",Positive,239,45
Deepak,2020-11-05 21:32:25,"What I say about this game. Everything is perfect but one think I miss in game and that is Multi-player option.

Chris Minjares,2020-11-04 08:27:21,"This is by far the best game I've played. It even took me away from assassins creed and for that reason I'm giving it 5/5. The combat is amazing , graphics system is pleasing to the eyes, the amount of quest voice overs and cut scenes ooz with delightful entertainment. Even the gacha system is very fair and giving id have paid for this game and still paid for gacha rolls its just that good!! Thank you for this masterpiece you've put together.",Positive,446,83
Brandon Morris,2020-10-29 04:31:01,Very much reminded me of breath of the wild graphics wise with JRPG flavor to it. Very fun and engaging right from the start. No prompting to buy some silly ingame currency at all since I started playing. Interested to try on different platforms since progress across the account carries. Would recommend trying out if you are at all a fan of Rpgs or Breath of the wild style combat and exploration.,Positive,399,72
Obaid Rahmani,2020-11-08 23:43:30,"Exceptionally detailed and immersive game. Wonderful storyline and characters. Epic music and environmental effects.

Forrest Perry,2020-11-11 05:56:52,This game is free to play. That said it is a gatcha game as well as a open world rpg in its infancy. I love the game. At the same time there are issues. But atleast the developer acknowledges that there are issues and attempts to fix them rather quickly,Positive,253,50
Rex Go,2020-11-11 06:01:34,"I enjoy the story and the map exploration with climbing and gliding, treasure chest hunting, gathering, , cooking, crafting and collecting characters. It feels like wacthing an anime but you are the main character. Only the resin requirement which is limiting the reward acquisition that can be use per day which could really makes more enjoyable to go domains and lay lines for more materials and mora gathering and boss drop hunting. But the game play is perfect.",Positive,465,78
Sly Saki,2020-11-11 09:33:42,"Really fun and addictive! There's glitches in Co-op however they're only minor and doesn't affect the gameplay you can also get free beginner pulls!

Chris Rowe,2020-11-12 10:59:41,"Few games are this well crafted. This game has beauty, storyline, engaging fighting, character development. The movement and physics are natural.

Isaac Pham,2020-11-11 15:10:30,"Great F2P action RPG. Co-op sucks, but they're working on it. It's basically a AAA title quality game that's free. Support the devs by buying some gems, but don't gamble your money away. It isn't necessary to spend money to have fun with this game.",Positive,248,45
BeardyNazz,2020-11-11 17:28:20,"Great experience on the go and at home. I play this game through cross-save, on mobile and pc.

Jizhi Huang,2020-11-01 01:55:38,"Great game even though the gacha is kind F*** up, I won't be able to expect using 5 stars with all unlocked constellation, Anyway, Please add function to Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Keyboard cover, Since my keyboard is huge I'm having hard time playing while holding it, would be better if there is shortcut to customize my keyboard buttons so i would be able to play at ease",Positive,369,68
"DEL ROSARIO, Ivan Jr. S.",2020-11-15 20:03:28,"I think acquaint fate should cost less than intertwined fate for there's no pity for 5 star items and have to rely so much more on luck. The extreme difficulty in getting appropriate main stat and even more with the appropriate sub stats for the artifacts, makes the progress pacing diverse for each players as farming is too much randomized. I just want to get higher chance in getting those stats. In Co-op mode, it would be easy if I could see if a player has taken down a boss.",Positive,481,90
Convergeman,2020-11-11 06:19:53,"Playing mainly on Android. This game easily rivals most dedicated console games in terms of its size and quality.

Natsky Desierto,2020-10-28 15:34:01,"Cool game. Nice graphics and pretty good controls. So far I've been players for hours and didn't even notice the time. Well thought about.

Pulyang Bruh,2020-11-04 19:51:21,"I'll give it a 5 star, cause of the gameplay and its cross platform feature.

D B,2020-11-06 04:09:32,"Great game! Very immersive and great attention to detail. Definitely an A++ game! Only features I'd like to see added is support for game controllers, and for us with high-end devices; an adjustment for further draw distance would be fantastic.",Positive,244,40
Hunter,2020-10-30 12:35:37,Have had quite a bit of fun with the game. Honestly one of the best mobile games I have played. It would only be better without microtransactions and some more fluid combat. Other than a few gripes the game runs nicely. It has nice story with nice graphics and themes with enjoyable combat. Lots to explore and see in the world. I say the game would be worth $30-$40 without microtransactions. With microtransactions like it is now I wouldn't mind throwing $20 in the game. Even if only support devs.,Positive,500,90
Thomased 69,2020-11-11 14:16:15,"Its a great game with detailed maps and great animation, the only problem i had was that this game was too huge and uses a lot of my storage. Other than that the gameplay was worth it. It had its similarities with zelda breath of the wild but i still enjoyed the story.",Positive,269,53
kaguya is bad,2020-11-11 19:27:14,"got me hooked so fast!! also the waiffus and husbandos oml, also the game exudes massive anime vibe, even the soundtracks are beautiful, but ofcourse there goes the gacha, it depends on your luck really, F2P or P2P it doesnt really matter as long as you grind for something you love (like Zhongli for example)",Positive,309,55
starrr winkle,2020-11-11 11:43:16,Love this game. Been playing this for almost a month now. Now im back to playing RPG games never been in love to RPG using phone. Usually i play RPGs on computer but given the chance to have a nice and huawei phone I can play now great games. Its like playing in your Nintendo or pc but very mobile you can play anywhere.,Positive,321,64
Yosia L,2020-11-13 23:15:59,"Game with one of the best, if not the best graphics ive ever played on my phone, no issues at all playing with max settings (im playing on ROG phone 2). Great gameplay also, interesting storyline, i do hope they add more ways to interact with other players. Overall easy 5*",Positive,273,51
Jojo Menninga,2020-11-11 13:29:13,"This game is a combination of breath of the wil, gacha games and gear leveling. It's amazing and the parts of the world we can explore right now are only 2/7 of the map. The game is amazing and I highly reccomend downloading it. (It's on ios, android, pc and playstation!)",Positive,272,51
Prickly Pear's Gaming,2020-11-12 00:35:44,"It's a well made game, but when it got to the black screen after the brother got taken, the loading symbols weren't moving at all. Then I closed and re-opened the game. It got stuck on a white screen with the same loading symbols. I have no idea why it did this because I have very fast wifi.",Positive,292,58
nonya bizness,2020-11-11 08:50:23,I love love love this game so much. I LOVE that it has a cross platform multiplayer mode. I'm not really a traditional gamer but my friends are and I love that I can now play a game with them that we all really enjoy! I'm excited to see what else they add over time!,Positive,266,55
Tony Ng,2020-11-06 14:48:16,"Hard work pays off. Top 9 grossing in 2 months after the game released (during pandemic!!) It shows how enticing the game is for premium players. But fear not, it is extremely f2p friendly. Resin (stamina in other games) was designed to keep p2w and f2p players gap narrow. p2w can get better characters faster and maximized their strength but f2p also given the chance to get them via daily quests, rewards, etc. Every 90th summons guarantees either a rare character or weapon or both.",Positive,486,85
lgbt FAM,2020-11-03 13:25:42,"Amazing game but please developer try to give an option on selling characters in exchange for primogems cause I literally have like 12 characters now and I dont literally use some of them, if we can exchange for like maybe 200-300 primogems then we have option to wish again for things that we might be able to use like weapons.",Positive,328,60
Ninja Nixon,2020-10-29 16:39:03,"This Game is 10/10 worthy that ign would be proud, probably the only flaw of the game there is its because it has gacha system and because you may need a specific device to even play the game, but beside those f2p can still have fun and you can do alot while not having to be involved with the main story.",Positive,305,61
Prpl_ ‚Ä¢ 64 years ago,2020-11-02 01:52:35,"The graphics are out of this world for a mobile game, and the story is great, and the voice acting is great, basically everything Is great, the game is better then some 1st party console games. The only thing I didn't like was how long it took to download.",Positive,256,49
Bimo Satrio,2020-11-05 19:42:37,"A game what i have dreamed around 8 years ago.. Good graphics, anime style, relaxing, semi online so no need to rush, multi platform with same experience, real cross platform, Can be free or paid if you want the best thing, non competitive. This game is perfect, now playing with my wife. We both enjoy playing together cross platform.. please maintain it and keep the good work :)",Positive,381,68
Riaan Malan,2020-10-30 15:43:57,"This game is truly amazing! Its been such a long time since I've enjoyed a game as much as this, a true masterpiece The only setback I feel is that I just wish that I could cross data between my ps4 and my phone. I do understand there are some politics involved, I just hope it can be sorted out so that the players can enjoy it any which way they prefer and not be bound to a chosen platform. Its been done before with games that have ingame purchases, so I'm sure its only a matter of time.",Positive,492,99
Warr tortle,2020-11-04 02:31:09,"Finally decided to check this game out and I am impressed. From the art style to gameplay, even the soundtrack. It all adds up to being an incredibly immersive game. Thoroughly enjoying my experience and I will definitely spend some to support it.",Positive,247,43
Goncalo Roque,2020-10-31 02:27:08,Amazing graphics for a free game. The game allows you to be free and explore the world instead of forcing you to do quests so you can do the quests at your own time which is great. Lastly the game has great artstyle and plays smoothly. So I recommend anyone to download genshin impact because it's a time killer and is really fun.,Positive,330,63
David McKowen-Taves,2020-10-29 14:41:41,Great game has a few glitches but something this big it is bound to happen. Overall I love it the glitches k refer to its difficult to grab items of the ground and the act one pirate mission had a glitch where the person you needed to talk wasn't there had to re load game and exit area for him to reappear.,Positive,307,62
Funny Bunny,2020-10-29 14:44:54,"Best action game ever, you can walk, run and sit. You also can climbing a tree, wall, mountain and a house too. Swimming and flying.. also got 4 element heroes. thE Game graphic is too incredibly great. thanks for the game. Very worth it and highly recommended.",Positive,261,47
dyeux Remington,2020-11-08 20:06:22,"Cant play on mobile so i play in laptop, BUT this game is insanely beautiful in graphics, story and balancing, although being a gacha game, even if your not a whale, i think that most people will find this game to be very fun, and i think you have a guaranteed 5 star up to ar35 (Hopefully)",Positive,290,57
Soham Dutta Roy,2020-11-09 12:58:12,"An absolute pleasure to play this game. The best game on mobile I have come across. This game is rewarding even if you are a F2P player, and so I would like it that way as there are shortage of games that are actually this good for F2P players.",Positive,244,49
live GAMING GIRL,2020-11-11 13:02:40,This is a fabulous game Android news this type of give and it is very very interesting game and having through trees and I cannot say how good is this game but one thing that I do not want it is we have to level upand the level is very long and always having transporter the task did not give the much XP give 200 XP but have to give mini like 300 this game is very very interesting and who all can download the game.,Positive,417,86
Parvez Ananta Rizky,2020-10-31 22:12:14,"HEY this game is EXTREMELY GOOD for F2P game, and im confused why so many people rate 1 star for this game because Framedrop issues its just because your device cant handle the game and its doesn't mean the game is trash lol and about gacha system its event not a big deal,its open world game and not pvp even me f2p player got 5 star on AR 33. For the Resin system yeah its draining very fast need and wait for a long time to get full hope they can update it soon.",Positive,465,94
Arty Eman,2020-11-02 21:21:56,"The Game has phenomenal graphics, as expected from mihoyo. the controls are rather a bit finicky on mobile. voice acting is 8/10. gameplay-wise the game is great. I kinda got dissappointed when I found out that genshin impact isn't related to honkai impact. Also Rates are abysmal and the Resin needs to be fixed. but other than that, the game is great.",Positive,353,62
r3drag000n red,2020-11-05 22:15:59,"A truly amazing game open world/gacha with lots to do and see and it runs beautifully on a phone for a open world the characters are great the gameplay is fun the world is beautiful, and its cross platform. This is a game with lots of love put into it and its definately worth a try.",Positive,283,56
Amir A.,2020-11-01 22:36:25,THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME. this game has a great story line easy to use fighting and leveling system and all the characters are great. If I had to name one downside it would be the long instalment but it is totally worth it if your reading my review and haven't downloaded genshin impact. What are you waiting for? download it now!,Positive,343,65
Adashi,2020-10-31 07:10:59,"Definetly one of the best mobile game you can play, does not have any single ads but does have very expensive gacha purchases. You do not have to spend a single dime to enjoy genshin impact fully as it is though ! The multiplayer on this isnt very exceptionnal but im very hopeful for improvements in a near future. Very fun overall would recommend anyone to try it !",Positive,367,69
Lionel Kho,2020-11-08 09:46:59,"Absolutely wand-erful! Kinda like BOTW but much improved with regards to gameplay such as leveling, characters, cooking, etc! Free to play without comitment to pay unless you want to... And for a game of such quality you would be tempted to pay as a way to thank the devs for such a wand-erful game!",Positive,299,54
Jason Ongsip,2020-10-29 12:43:00,"Genshin Impact is a legendary Anime Style Battle RPG with a Gacha System that you are NOT required to use. 100% playable with only the free characters, meant to be played casually and relaxing around the beautiful world created. Puzzles and chests abound everywhere, making you forget what you were doing and end up just exploring further and further along the open world.",Positive,372,63
flea,2020-10-29 18:55:19,Just installed this game and I can't believe how good it is. Didn't see microtransactions yet but hope they're not that bad. Came to the review page to see if there are any bad parts about it but people seem to downvote this game for the most stupid of reasons. Guess I'll just continue playing and come back later to review it properly.,Positive,337,63
Xz Trickyy,2020-11-07 20:55:08,"A very good mmorpg game, but you get to control your character freely is what i like most. Without using money to play the game i have unlocked very cool 4 star characters already. But its quite hard to get a 5 star character. I think you have to pay for those.",Positive,261,52
DA,2020-11-03 09:27:33,"I didn't expect much from mobile games at first but this game is absolutely unbelievable. Stunning graphics, amazing gfx, good music and sound effects, story line that gets you hooked and it legitimately looks like a graphic intensive computer game, but it plays on a phone! Easily can grant it 5 stars without hesitation.",Positive,322,54
Dafril Hafil,2020-11-11 07:30:35,"Even though overall this game is amazing, its really forcing you to go far as fast as you can. In order to do it, many people chooses to top up and buy things from this game. But if you okay with grinding than this game is perfect for you",Positive,238,49
Avinash Mali,2020-11-11 08:40:31,"Love this game. Really enjoy every aspect of open world and battles. Stormterror battles little bit chunky. There is cut scene in between battle where you can't move your character but Stormterror moves and your character still get dmg there. And update, why need to download whole thing again?",Positive,294,49
silver blade,2020-11-11 11:11:07,The only and only game that brings such beautiful GFX to mobile with cross platform support and also free stuff from time to time. Keep up the great work miHoyo. Buy the battlepass it's worth it and that should be enough to keep miHoyo afloat yet still keep this awesome game free to play.,Positive,289,54
jacob beveridge,2020-11-10 14:17:31,"I play this on PS4 and it is amazing. It's like LOZ Breath of Wild but better because you have multiple characters, better combat system, and weapons DO NOT BREAK!!!!! I hate LOZ Breath of Wild just for that reason. After playing it I had to get it for the phone.",Positive,263,51
Felix Juan,2020-11-10 12:01:43,"First I congrats mihoyo for make this awesome game 5-star for you..The Story is good, I enjoy the story while play this game..Gameplay is good and unique (with elements) not like other mobile games with elements win-lose but this game make win-win elements reaction this great point..for art I love this anime style art..for characters this interesting because no 1-3 star characters only 4-5 star characters this make me think this game really fair even you free player",Positive,470,78
Christian Onofre,2020-11-13 16:14:12,Honestly I don't have many problems with the game. I'd have to say the biggest one's I had were consulted in the latest update. Now my only problem is the insane drop rates for characters and items. But that's just mobile games I guess.,Positive,236,44
Star Chip,2020-11-12 03:55:09,"This game is amazing and fun,you can play with friends,have different characters,defeat monsters,and do quests!The only thing I wish they had was a custom character thing so you could make your own character,but I love the game either way!",Positive,239,39
Renz Anims,2020-11-15 15:23:54,"One of the best games I have played so far, but only one issue is that it lags in my phone.

alektoro,2020-10-28 15:38:13,"Great graphic, fluid controls, BoTW level game, f2p without ads. This deserves 6 stars compared to other mobile games. Too bad lots of people rating it 1 star because they rushed through the story line in one week of launch and complaining there's no content. I have easily played 20 hours and still just half way through the current story line.",Positive,345,61
Banana Taco!,2020-11-12 21:39:40,"The game is fun, good ost, good story and characters. But performance is not good. The game consumes battery very quickly, the game does not have great fps, phone can overheat easily. And there should be an aim assist as aiming on mobile is difficult.",Positive,251,45
Alejandro Mancilla,2020-11-11 07:06:39,"I've been playing this on mobile only, fantasy game.. will definitely be more enjoyable on PC.. gacha is always horrible no matter what game you play it on, resin refreshing is extremely bad in this one but over all I truly enjoy the game.. give it a try you won't be disappointed",Positive,280,52
sandya wisanggeni,2020-11-11 08:36:43,"Now with varies graphic settings, a mid end phone can play this game as well.

ferrel fernaldy,2020-11-03 18:34:51,"Best mobile game ever, breaking the wall between platform and mobile gaming. Stunning visual with interesting gameplay.

Syn Gates,2020-11-01 23:54:36,I absolutely love this game it has a great story plenty of loveable characters and you don't have to spend money to feel strong on it. And the map is HUGE I honestly can't believe its a free game. I am blown away by how good the graphics are as well!,Positive,250,51
meme guy,2020-11-02 15:29:17,"its amazing how addictive this game is,but i and many others do agree on something,i had an idea,to keep us playing this game u guys should put something like daily free roles,i cant spend any money on the game due to im to young and not having any jobs or money,i had high hopes for the game but soon when theres nothing to do,some players might left and didnt want to come back unless u give us something worth to play,theres many bugs too,you guys should fix that,not complaining just suggesting",Positive,498,91
Artificial Intellegence,2020-11-07 21:50:33,The game is great but I'm quite lazy so if there was an autoquest feature that people could toggle on and off it would just make it even better.

Kaia Jepsen,2020-10-31 10:10:46,"I absolutely love it! This game may be a lot like Zelda BOTW, but that's what I really like about it!

Xris tin,2020-11-08 22:04:57,I thought this game isjust like dragon raja but it is better and greater than that It really exceeded my expectations.

HexaTunes,2020-11-11 06:23:07,"All of this for FREE? You're getting $60 dollar content with no cost at all. I've poured about 75 hours into the game and I still have a lot of things to do. Now there are some issues, especially on lower end devices which I hope gets improved upon.",Positive,249,49

CLaire Qwheein,2020-11-11 21:39:39,One of the most f2p friendly game. Even if you don't have 5star characters you can definitely still beat the game. I play this on PC and it's just ridiculously good. Also mihoyo listens to their players feedback and they make some adjustments and that's a plus.,Positive,261,47
andre batac,2020-11-11 10:02:14,The best open world for me though this the first that I played. Graphics are out of this world so as the detail to each character development.

KARAKARAOKE OKE,2020-11-11 10:31:51,"when i saw the ad first time, i didnt expect to see a similar gameplay as the ad, the quality and the artwork, the storyline, its all amazing. this is def worth your time. if you have the space memory, go play it.",Positive,213,43
Dhiyandra Marini Utomo,2020-11-11 08:40:32,"It's a bit sad that you can't attack/aim mid air, but overall it's a fun game to play. The characters' designs are unique and the scenery in game are gorgeous. Again, it would be nice if the game allows us to attack or aim in the air.",Positive,234,47
Maddy loves jokes,2020-11-11 15:03:09,"This is by far one of the most fun mobile apps I've ever played. Be warned however, it takes up a lot of space on ones phone.

David Stuhlman,2020-11-12 04:24:15,"Fantastic new game. Cannot wait to see what updates come in the future, very high hopes based off of what we've gotten so far. Characters are amazing, exploring the map is thrilling and playing with friends is the icing on the cake.",Positive,232,42
JAVIER MUNOZ,2020-11-16 01:32:17,"I haven't played a game like it in a long time . To be a phone rpg game, it have almost everything to do and the places and it colors are wonderful. It reminds me the Fable game from PC . They did a great job doing that kind of game",Positive,232,51
Angelo De Leon Videra,2020-11-11 06:38:23,The game is very great. The openness of the game is what makes it nice. It lets you roam the map freely and it lets you do what you want in the game. The only downsides are the resin in the game it is so slow to refill and the resin needed are so expensive but over all it is great,Positive,281,61
Trash Can-t,2020-11-04 10:44:36,"Great game, i like the graphics, etc. I hope there's will be another event or more perma task or something, im at ar41, i still want to play it but there's no more task(only daily quest), i don't have anything to do when run out of resin, and makes me bored:(",Positive,259,51

Jane Suzuki,2020-11-10 13:04:16,"Mobile games have come so far, very impressed by the size of the open world and amount of content. Only a few issues being difficulty of aiming a bow on a small phone screen, and the trees can block your view during combat.",Positive,223,43
Vyxferr Dyferr,2020-11-11 07:52:35,"In general, really amazing! Would definitely recommend even if your a adult! But maybe not for kids under 11 and below. Since it's more of a strategy game play and story based game, plus the action. Perfect for adventurers!",Positive,223,39
Ahmed Elosta,2020-11-11 08:36:12,"This is game makes huge strides, pushing the limits of a mobile game.

Nathan Kendall,2020-11-11 11:29:54,"Great anime mmorpg similar to botw.

Bernie,2020-11-12 01:53:37,"This game is amazing! If you're a big fan of BOTW you'll love this! The only problem I have is the gacha system. The rates are less than 1% foe getting a five star. The rate should be at least 3%-5%. Otherwise, I love everything about his game!",Positive,244,48
Megan Maher,2020-11-12 03:18:52,I love this game so much. I love how everything can be climed or swam or shot or anything.

egar iman,2020-11-11 07:34:25,"Hi there! Its an awesome game you developed here. Its like a whole package! Just one little problem that annoys me, please fix the interferes when Players are in Co-op mode. Players cant buy or interact with Seven God Statues. So please do your magic!",Positive,251,45
Michael S,2020-11-03 00:41:27,"The peak of gacha games. An incredibly detailed, handcrafted open world with a stellar soundtrack. Perfectly feasible to play without spending any money. Being able to seamlessly switch between mobile and PC is a huge plus. Highly recommend!",Positive,241,38
Warp,2020-11-02 10:04:50,"Genshin Impact was really fun to play especially for the first 30 hours. After that it got a little grindy. My favourite part was exploring the map and taking photos. On mobile, the graphics and controls are a little worse but still a 5/5 mobile and pc game.",Positive,258,48
Nichole Waggoner,2020-11-02 03:30:42,Looks great and I'm definitely enjoying it so far. My only frustration is that the on screen joystick gets frustrating in narrow paths where you can fall off and die. Experienced my first character KOs on the levitating platforms in one of the wind temples.,Positive,257,45
Freh S,2020-11-01 07:03:33,"I love this game. Got it because of freinds' recemendations and i havent regretted it once. The story, music, characters and gameplay are all balanced in an amazing way and I've already racked up about 35 hours on it in a week of having it.",Positive,240,45
Wilbert Vera,2020-10-29 07:35:33,Awesome I want to link this to my account on my ps4 so I can continue farming and controller support to help mitigate my reaction time but other than these that I'm sure just take time the game is definitely great I usually don't stay interested in games with a gacha pull mechanic but the way you farm materials in game along with the story and graphics made that the farming task fun and actually enjoyable keep up the awesome work,Positive,433,81
Jacob Selby,2020-11-02 12:26:35,"Wow, So this game is what you would get if The Legend of Zelda: Breathe of The Wild and Anime came together. It is amazing. This is probably the best game I have played of 2020 and if you didn't know. It is on Console! for Free, which is insane.",Positive,245,50
lalith chandra,2020-11-01 17:16:15,"Guys trust me, this game is way good so dope this is the best mobile game you see the graphics is like you're in a fantasy world so dope the animations and the storyline is super awesome but if their is one thing wroug it is that this game is very high and it is not acceable to low end devices I told my friends to download thus game but some of my friends have low end devices so their not able to play I am sad about that but other things this game is super awesome dope.",Positive,474,98
Heather D,2020-11-08 04:58:37,Love this game the only thing that bothers me is when I'm attacking enemies and monsters the camera goes wherever it wants. Doesn't stay on target. I have to turn the camera back to target but other than that. I love everything about this game,Positive,243,45
Joshua Edward,2020-10-28 19:30:07,"This game felt like it was made exactly the way I want, except maybe on the resin system that needs a bit of an improvement. I hope there will be a controller support for android version. Also, I think the game needs to be optimized for android better.",Positive,252,48
Brandon Wyatt,2020-10-29 03:42:58,"Isn't this also on PC? This is just mind blowing for a phone game. The graphics, story, voice acting. It brings back my childhood rpg gaming days on my ps2! 20/10 get this game!!!!! Keep up the amazing work!",Positive,207,39
Tove Svan,2020-11-07 10:12:50,"great game! i'm not into rpgs usually but this just hooked me in, the open world is incredible, and quests are everywhere to be found if you look close enough at seemingly non important details! BUT the resin system needs to be worked on because it's very flawed as is, and the trails in tianqiu quest is impossible, there needs to be an option to abandon a quest!!",Positive,365,68
Hannah Herzfeld,2020-11-04 09:07:24,"I was so easily obsessed with this game! The co-op cross platform is quite impressive and the game play and story AND graphics are to die for. There are a few things left to be desired but since this game is so new, I don't blame him",Positive,233,47
Illya Laurette,2020-11-11 08:22:17,"This game is great. The open-world design, complexity, endless combination and skills. I will recommend this to any RPG game lover! *dying wallet noise in the background* And, to conclude my review, I will give this a 5-star!",Positive,225,38

Arzanish Shumak,2020-11-11 05:48:08,"I really like this game. it gives me a good story, fighting content I enjoy and a way to pass the time with quests and items to collect. I like that the world is so vast and there are so many places to discover, it really feels like an adventure!",Positive,246,50
Miawilabella,2020-11-13 11:05:18,I really love this game it is the best!!! All of the characters are so amazing and detailed! The aim on the characters and the super moves are perfect. It is an amazing bordom killer and you can even play with friends.,Positive,218,42
Shyn Shynee,2020-11-11 10:34:50,"The graphic is fine, as well as the game play (it's a little bit hard to control on mobile tho). It's an open world, you can explore when and wherever you want. This is a good game for free, excellent job miHoYo!",Positive,212,42
Charlotte S.,2020-11-14 00:18:32,I am enjoying this game far more than i thought i would. The graphics are stunning. The control and leveling up of character is a little tricky but you get use to it as you play. The story is great. The voice and music are bomb!,Positive,228,46
Tushar Chaudhari,2020-11-13 04:03:43,"It's one of the best rpg i have played, it's amazing. But there are quite few frame drops are occurring i even tried to lower graphic. It's good that it didn't occur in Spiral Abyss. It occur sometime while exploring map . Hope devs will fix it soon",Positive,249,48
Atty EA,2020-11-11 11:28:14,"It has set the bar high for mobile games! A RPG Great story, world-building, platforming and puzzles, treasure hunting, and more! To avoid syncing problems, make a mihoyo account. Content can be finished even with basic characters, so getting those 5 star heroes is only a bonus.",Positive,279,47
Zekiah Hebz,2020-11-11 12:24:18,"My kind of game... But after the nov. 11 update, it lags so much everytime i go to menu or check my character or level them up. My settings is already at the lowest.

Marie Kim,2020-11-01 04:50:21,"Love this game. It changes the way rpg and gacha games are. I am tired of the traditional rpgs. Not only is the story rich, but the format and design of the game is really innovative. Keep up the good work!",Positive,206,41
Lila Bash,2020-11-01 21:04:06,"I love this game it breaks the rolls of other games I've played, like I can climb and glide that is soooooooooo fun to do. One thing that I recommend on this game is that we can fly up then this game would be absolutely amazing/ perfect.",Positive,237,47
Hari Govind,2020-10-30 22:52:31,"this is an amazing concept and i absolutely love it! the graphics, the gameplay, the storyline absolutely spot on! I'd recommend the PC version as it's free too! but phone also works and good job! waiting for content patches eagerly.",Positive,233,40
jrjosh thegreat,2020-11-02 17:15:20,"Simply the best game I have ever played, I have one suggestion though, try adding bosses that appear randomly on the map and that are very challenging, rewards should be primogems or anything that is not common.",Positive,211,37
Slendykid slenderkid,2020-11-05 16:11:24,I like the controls it does a lot better then most games and the gameplay makes me almost feel like I'm playing on a game console The graphics are mostly good and im glad they finally put guys in this game and I'm liking the yaoi romance too its nice to have a change to yaoi mainly because thats more my preference And having guy characters is a nice refreshment to what I was wanting the gameplay I hope my comment helps and is easy enough to read,Positive,449,88
Qader Jbr,2020-11-14 12:36:37,"this game is ridiculous. My lil brother does not even play regularly but when he pulled wishes he already got Keqing...Me, on the other hand, play and grind like hell to get some primogems just get a bloody 4 star weapon...Wow by the way i still play the game and addicted after all that...marvelous game Mihoyo! thumbs up!",Positive,323,58
Montanose Gaming,2020-11-01 17:24:48,The game is very cool I love open world games as they are my fav But only one thing is negative in this game The graphics are too high the game is laggy is because the shadows and very far render distance and high texture quality Especially the effects There are too much effects in this game with a very high texture If you could give settings to turn shadow turn shadows off Effects to be decrease the amount of effects and texture quality And decrease render in lowest Pls add it and thank you,Positive,496,95
Klyde Lerin,2020-11-05 10:06:30,"Love the characters, the graphics, gameplay .. still early in the game and hope to discover more even though it may seem hard to navigate at first. Hope to get more characters in the game though and enjoy the game more.",Positive,219,41

James Webb,2020-10-30 04:36:12,"Honestly, this game is perfection, or at least the closest game I've seen to perfection. Literally my only thing that I think could be improved is adding a place to fully heal the group perhaps with a percentage based cost of Mora.",Positive,231,42
FrozenFacade,2020-11-10 23:08:20,"This game is gorgeous on PC, the content is beat-able as a F2P if you're dedicated. This style of game is a bit hard to control on mobile but it works for small tasks when you're away from home, get the PC version.",Positive,214,43
Farrih Alam,2020-11-11 12:54:42,"best free to play as long as you can manage and or limit you wish/banner. great open world, full of adventure and many great stuff. reshin sure are downside especially since this game also available on PC&PS4 but lots of stuff are doable without reshin so that's that.",Positive,268,48

Shubh Ramolia,2020-11-14 16:00:03,"This game is perfect in all aspects;take graphics,controls,map, beautiful environment etc. But it would be great if there was a vehicle so that to travel faster like a horse or a bike(which could be called as magical something...)",Positive,230,38
maulana indra,2020-11-12 00:50:25,"this game like mix of some famous game and anime title. zelda botw exploration system, gacha and char switch battle system similar with blade switch and gacha from xenoblade chronicle, hunter x hunter similar soundtrack in some area if im not wrong. yes, they mix a lot of element into they own original brand new game.",Positive,319,56
Widi Syahrizal,2020-11-11 09:53:52,"The control button need some customization .. and playing to this day haven't see another player to talk to Edit: the coop mode and ""Battle Pass"" enabled on adventure rank lv 20.

Reka Mey,2020-10-30 17:44:27,"This game is really cool, I can feel an exciting adventure from the storyline. And most importantly the graphics are really cool. So it won't be bored and in fact you will really feel at home playing this one game for a long time.",Positive,230,44

Pierre-antoine Denarie,2020-10-30 02:53:40,"Absolutely splendid. You get a big open world, wacky characters, decent story and some sleek gameplay! And all that for the low price of .. nothing! It feels a bit like a mix of breath of the wild and the witcher. Great!",Positive,220,42
SV mshp,2020-11-11 07:06:13,At first I thought they are kidding about the gameplay on their advertisement but when I actually played the game I was impressed! Although you need a lot of storage maybe 10GB or more but it was worth it! Please give it a try!,Positive,227,44
AOP 765,2020-11-12 02:08:14,"I still can't believe this game is free!! In spite of the ingame purchases, there's so much amazing story content and even more to come in the future, making this game exciting and fresh now and also for months to come!",Positive,219,41

Lakindu gunasekara,2020-11-11 10:20:04,It's incredible to see that the mobile game market has come this far that we can get to play proper actual rpg style big games on our phones now. While the gacha mechanics can be a bit disheartening at times that didn't tamper my overall experience with the game.,Positive,263,49
Jzzz zzz,2020-11-11 20:42:50,thanks for fixing the bug issues in mediatek processors but I have a new problem all of the grass disappeared completely and my venti's aim got worse.

Jericho Carlo Sarmiento,2020-11-13 20:17:10,"Graphics is outstanding, the main story is good. I love the way how the game runs. It feels like this is what I've been longing for. I wish it could also be played at VR hehehehe although I can't afford it üòÇ",Positive,207,42
black magik32,2020-11-11 13:30:12,It's a really good game and even with the lowest graphic settings it has great experience to it but the only problem is that it takes almost 10 minutes to start and on between gameplays it sends me back to the home screen and I have to start it all over again,Positive,259,52
Kate Leahy,2020-11-13 11:54:26,I'm disappointed i was going to play again after a bit and all of my progress had had been removed and I had to redownload the files and like I said I'm really disappointed I was starting to get some good character's but other than that it's a fantastic game.,Positive,259,50
Raditya Setiawan,2020-11-10 14:53:25,"Its an amazing game, and one of my favorite. Even if you don't spend money, it still playable. I am waiting for the new region update. Its an amazing game you can't find other game like this in mobile, so i'll give another‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",Positive,227,43
Madcap Riflette,2020-11-06 13:33:50,This is a very fun game however I want to ask for a future update where you are able to use a connected controller on a mobile. The mobile controls hinder some of of what I wanted to do so I bought a ps4 controller and connected it to my phone for smoother gameplay.,Positive,266,54
Anthony Bohnsack,2020-10-29 22:52:14,"Very fun, progress carries over from pc to phone. Good graphics and excellent controls for touch. Needs controller support. I don't like the Gacha stuff, but the game is 100% playable without ever spending a dime. Very well done game.",Positive,234,40

Timmah tb,2020-11-11 07:29:31,"Probably the best phone game I'm ever played. Yes its a rip off of BOTW but that's a good thing, and its free. The paid options aren't in your face and you don't need them to progress. Overall super happy with it",Positive,212,42
Virgilio,2020-11-11 06:13:37,"Amazing game, i love the story and characters, but i think it would be amazing to feature the characters in the main story, like fischl or Beidou, and to increase the chances of getting primogems. But overall, good game",Positive,219,39
Gaming 24/7,2020-11-11 06:16:38,Best game I've played on the phone. One problem is that if you turn off your phone it will make you reconnect to the server meaning if you were in a temple you would have to restart from that quest. Otherwise its great.,Positive,219,43
Josiah Rand,2020-11-10 09:03:12,"New to anime and was pleasantly surprised. Haven't had this much fun in forever. Great graphics, story, characters and music. And best of all it's cross play between Android/iOS/PC/Mac! Everything is synced wherever you play!",Positive,225,35
Matt Kim,2020-11-11 07:27:48,"Excellent diversity of game aspects, musical choice in different scenarios, and quite an intriguing and immersive game that's able to be played on android, PC, etc. Game is rather large, but the size is worth it with the captivating gameplay.",Positive,242,40
Kevin Runtu,2020-11-11 04:31:03,"It's an amazing game, but please fix the camera angles. When I'm fighting the camera automatically moved and all I can see is neither trees or grass or other objects near me. It's became hard to fight the enemies",Positive,212,39
Krist S,2020-11-10 16:25:04,"This is a super awesome game. Storyline, gameplay, graphics, and artwork. The bgm and vo are pretty awesome too! However this kind of game is best played on a pc rather than a mobile phone. This is still very good tho.",Positive,218,41
Cody Dean,2020-11-10 23:30:25,"The king of all Gacha games! Fun, rewarding, dialogue and translations that actually make sense! Great characters, a gacha pity system, the list goes on and on. If you're a gacha game lover or just a fantasy or anime fan you'll love this game.",Positive,243,44
Robert Fiasconaro,2020-11-11 11:56:18,"One of the best free to play games period, and the fact it can run on phones is insane! It's a real beautiful game and characters like Venti and Diluc are some of my all time favorite characters in any game ever. 10/10 would recommend",Positive,234,45
VicK's,2020-11-11 11:45:52,Good game really impressive that such a good game is available in mobile. But the slow story updates is kinda boring and hard to maintain . People are already maxing their characters and the story is still not even halfway. Quite unbalanced.,Positive,241,42
Ragib Ashab,2020-11-14 05:51:31,"If only they would decrease the resin regeneration timer instead of increasing the resin cap. Nevertheless one of the best games i played this year. Since it's cross platform save(android,ios and pc) its really helpful to keep track of things.",Positive,243,40
whattechnologyneeded for all rounder,2020-11-14 15:58:04,"Great gaming experience, first time playing RPG style games and I am blown away by this game.

Falentino Gilbert Assa,2020-11-11 16:15:15,"Definitely one of IF not the best ARPG i ever played on mobile. Beautiful artwork, deep lore, vast open world, this game really doesn't compare to other mobile games RPG. Highly recommend it if you are into RPG games like BoTW, TES, FF, etc.",Positive,241,44
Zac Evans,2020-11-11 11:52:18,"To be honest, this was the most fun i had in awhile now. I have been playing it non-stop because this game has the kind of gameplay style that i like the most. Genshin Impact might properly be my favorite game so far.",Positive,217,43
Yozu Yozu,2020-11-11 19:50:35,"The best Single player Open World game On android(this game not MMORPG but have Co-op)..but make sure you have Strong phone before Download.

Johann Daniel Morales,2020-11-06 17:08:54,This game is epic! But I noticed some youtubers quitting because of the endgame content. For this to be resolved I suggest to add a daily reward system. That will greatly impact the game for both f2p and p2w players. Hope you notice this developers!,Positive,249,45
Jay shelar,2020-11-12 09:18:11,"This game is unbelievably good. The graphics,the story, and the OST gives me chills everytime. But it has some glitches hope they'll fix it in future. Otherwise this game is worth its download size.",Positive,198,34
I AM BASTARD,2020-11-07 03:14:08,"Genshin Impact is a game with two conflicting identities. It's a gorgeous open-world RPG that adopts much of what made Nintendo's Breath of the Wild outstanding while carving a niche all its own. It's also a remarkably greedy gacha game, even when compared to more traditional gacha games.",Positive,289,48
Patrick's Gaming Zone 11,2020-11-01 16:00:10,"very good good game if you dont rush. relaxing graphics, good combat. over all good game. if you are f2p player no need to compete with other players just make a 4 star team combination you're good till end game. mihiyo just increase the rate up of 5star and we good haha",Positive,271,52
R A,2020-10-29 04:27:43,This looks like a really good game. The only complaint I have is the cutscenes. It prevents players with low end devices in order to play. This is a very resource intensive game but I just wish that they would remove unnecessary content in order to make it more playable.,Positive,271,50
Charlie Shen,2020-11-08 02:31:29,"Love this game! Beautiful worlds, strategic combat, unique characters...you really cannot ask for more! Don't listen to the resin haters...this game literally just came out a month or so ago! Great for F2P players.",Positive,214,34
M. Akbar Athallah,2020-10-29 09:43:51,"I'm have a lot of fun in this game! Although it's still at early release, the content is already fun! If you want to enjoy the gameplay, i recommend you to play it slowly, no need to hurry, because it's still in it's early stage.",Positive,229,45
D.J. M,2020-11-01 06:28:36,Finally a game you can really dive in without commercials or pay to succed items. Sure if you wanna spend you can. But the game itself doesnt need it at all. Great to have a game that plays this well.,Positive,200,40
SweetPotato x,2020-10-31 08:29:27,"This game is absolutely incredible. The graphics, the storyline, the voices, the controls and so on. Although it freezes up from time to time, I definitely recommend downloading this game. It's worth your time.",Positive,210,34
Michael Vandendriessche,2020-11-06 00:38:29,It's fun and high quality. The monetization is not in your face. I'm still early into the game. I will likely spend money on it later exactly because they are not constantly reminding me to pay. The gameplay comes first.,Positive,220,40
Fahmi Hazizi,2020-11-12 15:34:29,"I am truly in love in this game. The quests are all good, and some challenges demands everything a real advanturer shoild have like navigation skills and wit. But there are more things I wish I can do in game like character customisation and petting the dogs..",Positive,260,47
Rebecca Esterhuizen,2020-11-11 09:14:15,"Very fun game that I thoroughly enjoyed. While there are definitely parallels with Breath of the Wild, it is ultimately its own game, with its own story. 10/10 even if my phone has a stroke when I try to play",Positive,208,40
Stardrop Gacha,2020-11-12 00:05:24,"100% recommend it. Beautiful music, scenery, and items. I just wish you could co-op at AR 5 and a little higher chance of a 5 star charater... The story line and lore of this game is amazing as well! (No spoilers here)",Positive,218,42
Usagi2WinZ,2020-11-15 21:25:13,The graphics are great and I see no flaw wether its about the gameplay or its about the exploration.....full support from me Ps:i really love the climb puzzle. It make me feel like I'm playing assassin's creed but its even harder since there is stamina bar,Positive,256,46
Life is hard without Mona,2020-11-11 06:00:13,So far it's good but my only dissatisfaction is that most of my friends are from EU and I'm from Asia so we can't play together unless we change server and make a whole new account and that's really bothersome. I really hope they do something about it,Positive,251,48
Etienne James,2020-10-28 23:44:42,"Truly magnificent.

Jackson Funke,2020-10-31 02:31:04,"It's a legend of zelda: breath of the wild rip off, but even with that said, it's still fun, but If i could change something, i would remove the adventurer level cap, where you can't do the main quest until i have a higher adventurer level",Positive,239,46

Yoongi's Rose,2020-11-11 07:31:21,In the co op mode when you get kicked or leave even if all your pings are green. My screen just goes completely black for a while until I have to log out and log back in. I've tried this on other devices and it's the same.,Positive,222,47
Farizal Razali,2020-11-11 06:16:50,"Awesome gameplay, graphics. F2P, but if youre willing to spend some money $, its also worth it. Do take note though, they use a gacha system for heroes and items. Means base on luck to get rare heroes and weapons.",Positive,213,40
Lubna Rofiq,2020-11-11 18:44:43,"I literally dont know how this game is free, just download it, u wont regret it. The only downside is If u have a bad phone so sometimes when the cutscenes play your phone cant handle the graphics and just shows pixels but I personally dont mind.",Positive,246,47

Summer Herc,2020-11-11 09:30:33,"Compared to the other gachas...

Jester Lhee Pandio,2020-11-07 03:41:46,The missions are great. But it will be better if there's a way to view again list of enemies encountered and rewatch cut scenes again since most of them are stopping despite having a good internet connection.,Positive,208,37
Abhayansh Deo Kumar,2020-11-11 00:48:24,"Probably one of the best games I have ever played. If someone out there is looking for a nice RPG to play then Genshin impact is the perfect one. The story, the characters, the weapons and the bosses are insane.",Positive,211,40
Aries Fernando,2020-11-11 08:28:35,"One of the greatest mobile RPG games ever made. Graphics are good, Story and Lore is ever-interesting, and Mechanics are easy to understand. Farming is relatively easy but requires patience like any other RPG.",Positive,209,34
Keke Pam,2020-11-12 07:13:25,There aren't really any massive cons with this game overall its really enjoyable. The only request would be in future updates allow some adjustments to controls and if possible allow other players to communicate via a lobby or something of that sort,Positive,249,42
Ea,2020-11-12 01:20:45,"Great game so far but since its a large game and has very detailed graphics, be prepared for it to take up a few gigabytes of storage and to heat up your phone üòÖ other than it taking up alot of storage its a great game and has a good storyline",Positive,243,51

Jasfer Ryan,2020-11-04 17:17:00,"by far the best rpg on mobile. just a suggestion, I know this game is intended for consoles but why not optimize the game not just for high end mobile but for mid range too. that way your market can expand by a triple fold",Positive,222,45
Cem Kucukhasanoglu,2020-11-08 13:26:39,"An rpg with stunning graphics, nice and deep combat, a vast open world environment, gacha mechanics, cool soundtrack and anime shenanigans. Coolest looking mobile game I have seen so far, that plays nice and smooth as well.",Positive,223,37

Adrian Stefan Georgescu,2020-11-08 19:12:11,"This game is super free2play friendly. Although summoning rates for a 5star character are really low, which should be a bit higher than 0.7%. This game has a lot of good qualities, that you even find in a 60Euro game",Positive,216,40
Warren BSCE,2020-11-11 08:39:04,Really good. Hope they fix where you can get a lot of duplicate characters. Yea I know they're needed too for constellation but it will be boring if they duplicate like a lot. Like I got 5 fischl on my 30 spins.,Positive,211,42

You may not experience any difficulty on a flagship Samsung or iPhone ect, but just keep in mind it requires good phone specs for the best experience and to minimize the chance of bugs or crashes. Also, I'm surprised to see it's not ""pay to win"". Can progress for free, but you'll want to buy stuff.",Positive,498,91
Matt Norsworthy,2020-11-08 20:20:57,"Awesome but getting less so everytime I play, bosses disappear and re-appear with full health making it impossible to kill them I've spent 3 hours trying to beat an ever re-healthing enemy this game can suck a fat D!",Positive,216,39
Felix‚Äôs freakles,2020-11-08 09:18:15,Really fun and enjoyable! Although sometimes it lags and glitches but it still ends up working. Its really fun and I love the character designs and scenery,Positive,155,27
Ivan Lloyd Quirino,2020-11-11 06:33:57,"nice game, its fun, thrilling, exciting, the map is huge and awesome, the details, but sadly my phone can't handle the graphics of this game , but overall this game is #1, ‚ò∫Ô∏è",Positive,174,33
Gerardo Bocanegra,2020-10-31 12:29:09,Really loved the game. The landscape and over all characters are quite nice. I just wish it was on xbox or atleast geoforce now so I can play anywhere. Or atleast on my chrome.,Positive,176,34
Lim Xiao Thung,2020-11-02 09:01:25,"If you love battle RPG games and anime, I would recommend this game to you. The characters have amazing designs and backstories about them. The graphics are incredible, especially on PC (it's still great on mobile). There are many places to explore, it seems like it's never-ending, which made me keep playing the game. Although you may see some YouTubers spending thousands of money on this game, it's actually F2P! I turned out to be very lucky on my second free roll. In my opinion, I like the story quests more as it's very interesting, the voice acting is great too! You can even earn free characters (or constellations if you have them already) by battling the Spiral Abyss.",Positive,680,119
Altissia,2020-11-08 19:35:39,"Game looks great, fluid battle, F2P friendly. I hope they fix some of the camera, and rubberbanding in weekly boss fight. We need much better event tho, compared to HI3 this game has almost none.",Positive,195,35
Adam Henry,2020-11-11 07:47:56,Amazing game with hundred of hours of exploration and tones of characters. You don't need to buy anything but supporting the company of a free game is cool.,Positive,156,28
Alam Hussain,2020-11-11 11:37:17,This game is one of the best ROG games i have ever played on a mobile phone. There is just so much to do and just when you think that you have seen everything in the game you see something new. Overall it's an awesome experience.,Positive,229,46
Tropical Yeti,2020-11-12 01:46:39,"This game is as high quality as a $60 console game, and it's free on mobile! It has great graphics, characters, and gameplay and it doesn't even slow down my phone",Positive,163,31
Aaron Lee,2020-11-11 05:06:33,"Now this is how a mobile RPG should be made! The Gatcha isn't really pay to win, all the characters are good, you can easily craft epic quality weapons. Overall this game is 10/10",Positive,179,34
Ren,2020-11-11 07:34:41,Great game. Mor than enough content to satisfy a casual gamer without expense. Gacha is nice since pretty much any character is viable and it simply addsnflavor to the game. Really good work Mihoyo!,Positive,198,34
Saiful Islam Khan,2020-11-12 23:14:01,Very good game. I felt like I was playing on a console and forgot I was on mobile while playing it! The only flaw I saw was lacking of a mount.,Positive,143,31
Logan Ciesla,2020-11-15 05:36:33,"I originally thought that this wasn't going to be very good, but then i started playing, and it's awesome. It has beautiful graphics, an amazing storyline, and great sound design.",Positive,179,30

Gabriel Castillo,2020-11-11 09:49:37,"Finally, an adventure RPG game like Final Fantasy on mobile yet it brings more to the game. Can't really describe my excitement from playing this game! You guys have to play it yourselves to experience this wonderful game~!",Positive,223,38
DE GUZMAN MARK ANGELO,2020-10-28 17:58:09,This game make you feel like you're in the game. Making it so immersive and fun to play. But the drawback is the is so heavy but all in all best game in 2020!,Positive,158,34
Weird Boi,2020-10-29 06:38:00,"I'm honestly having a great time with the game. The primogems y'all freely give out were more than enough to give me most of the characters I wanted, so that's pretty cool. One problem I've been having is that my game often times closes unexpectedly after just a few minutes of playing. Hopefully this is a problem on the games end and not because of my, admittedly, kinda trash phone. Other than that, keep up the good work y'all!",Positive,431,79

Emily Niggemeyer,2020-11-11 08:13:33,"I absolutely love this game! I cannot stop playing it. It does lag quite a bit, however, I am playing it on my phone. I would definitely recommend this if you love open world games!",Positive,181,35

Davian Abbot M.,2020-11-04 11:39:31,"very good game, the graphics are amazing and the game is very fun, but can the game have a quest scene replay? to replay the scenes because sometimes i mute the volume to hear my teacher in the zoom.",Positive,199,39

Oni Sensei,2020-11-09 02:57:54,As if I really need to leave a review lol. The game is absolutely amazing there are a few systems it lacks but it is still a phone game after all üòÖ compared to anything else on the market however its the king of mobile games üëå,Positive,226,47
Jeff Jeff!!!,2020-11-11 06:35:39,I love this game because the history and the gameplay are interested to keep playing it as much as I like to do. After at all I think is ones of best games Anime that I never seen it before.,Positive,190,40

Collin Hoagland,2020-11-12 11:11:56,Honestly this game is so cool. It's basically Legends of Zelda Brwath of the Wild. The graphics are amazing and I'm pretty addicted to it even though I'm pretty bad.,Positive,165,30

Juliana Sachez,2020-11-11 15:36:42,The game is so good! I live it so much. From a pearson who dosnt have a pc to play these types of games on. I'm so happy they don't limit anything to just pc!,Positive,158,35
AMISH KAPURIYA,2020-11-13 09:49:18,Game is lot of fun...i wish there is a skip option in some clips/cuts scenes. Also the map can have more interactive options like toggle for showing/hiding anemoculus and geoculus(would be really helpful).,Positive,205,33

bob buns,2020-11-05 04:35:08,This game sets a high bar for other mobile games. The only issue is the controlling of the bow andnclumbing but that may just be my big fingers or because it's a phone game,Positive,172,34
Khatrina Cadiente,2020-11-05 11:34:54,"Love it very much! Even though the game requires a big amount of storage space, still what you get after will make you satisfied.",Positive,129,24
Ikhsan Syah,2020-11-04 12:45:34,"a very good and interesting game in the world of adventure that can be played on a cellphone or PC, everything looks real and cool, Keqing is my favorite adventurer, thank you",Positive,175,32
Vikrant Deshmukh,2020-11-06 12:42:44,"Game is very nice. One of the best game on play store.For me it somewhat like GOD OF WAR type game , not that much action but sufficient to play on Android. Story lineup is also great.",Positive,184,37
eming chan,2020-10-30 11:55:05,"This game is a beautiful union between rpg, gacha, and open world. I've seen many complaints about the lack of content, resin, materials, AND mora, but the thing is, they are pacing the game for both their updates and the player's time spent. I suppose that this game is designed so that you can actually take your pace playing the game, and it's actually appealing! Contrasting from other gacha games where you may need to grind an entire day. So yeah, give it a try and some chances. :))",Positive,489,89
Mulya Sara,2020-11-09 01:33:27,"It's so good, the graphic, world building, everything is so awesomee!! My only concern is, i need more quest to advance quickly :( since i notice the chest doesn't respawn frequently",Positive,182,31
Samanvya Gautam,2020-11-09 13:42:21,This game is the BEST! The graphics are on par with the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild! And the soundtrack and the story! Love it! It gets 5 stars from me!,Positive,160,33
Thaveshni Govender,2020-11-10 12:30:18,"This is game is amazing. I really love the quality. I play it on my note 10 phone. The only downside is that the controls are difficult to use when trying to aim and shoot an arrow. I just wish it would auto align because for a phone its just too small to control it well if you know what I mean. Overall its a great game, it makes you think and solves puzzles. I like that the puzzles are not that hard and that they reward you with a special scene if you get it right. It flows with a story.",Positive,493,102
Niko Ace Borrero,2020-11-12 05:23:48,App is crashing :'((( it automatically restarts my phone ever since I got to the jade temple. It only crashes on my account that is doing the new quest. Edit: Thank you for fixing everything immediately :))) more power,Positive,218,39

Rahad Siddiqui,2020-11-14 00:22:09,After the update the game became so laggy.. So much fps drops in certain areas..Sometimes it drops to 18-22 fps in some area (e.g. Guili Plains) but it was not laggy before the update. My device has Snapdragon 855+ chip.,Positive,220,40
Atthline Patrick,2020-11-11 10:59:50,"I really enjoy playing this game. The sceneries, mysterious yet enchanting storyline, very cool characters and many more. In short,MIHOYO you did a great job.",Positive,158,25

xLiqht,2020-11-11 13:56:45,The graphics and gameplay are phenomenal! Bad thing about having such a beautiful game is that it takes very long to download in game updates.,Positive,142,25
Nmz,2020-11-12 07:39:27,The new 1.1 update is amazing. I hope every update will bring huge new things and solve issues just like this one. Thanks for listening to our requests.,Positive,152,28
CD912 Reviews,2020-10-19 03:27:35,"An overall amazing experience. I love the mechanics of the game such as the combat, cooking, and gliding. It's similar to BOTW, and I love the aspects similar to it like the climbing. Amazing graphics. Amazing storyline. The controls are great. Everything's nice and organized. Definitely my favorite Free to play game of all time.",Positive,331,55
Jerry Mallare Jr,2020-10-29 16:06:09,"I'm actually playing on PC. The game is amazing and beautiful. My only problem is the connection error when the game starts. Also, I hate the fact that you can't switch apps when GI is running. It will close the game and load again. Even if you accidentally pressed your home button, the game thinks you closed it. So another load time.",Positive,336,62
Akmal Zulhilmi,2020-10-18 02:00:26,"In my honest opinions, the game plot, characters, movements and even their reactions are well made, my only problem is that at certain cut scenes, the video got lag and only the sound went well. Maybe it was my phone cause it couldn't handle the graphics, other than that, the game itself is very enjoyable, player friendly, very kind in helping players and I got addicted playing it on first day playing it.",Positive,408,73
John Royce Perez,2020-11-12 05:35:51,There is a spot that when get there it is so lag and I did not experience it before the update. Before the update my gameplay was smooth in low rendering and the rest is medium now Its not.,Positive,189,39
Dark_Wolf93,2020-11-01 13:16:00,Im in love with the game so much it's so relaxing and calming but the only thing I wish you could customize your own character at last but still a really great game 5 stars all around,Positive,183,37
Ferdinand Didier Dmitri Meyer,2020-11-11 10:57:58,By far one of the best games ever. Really enjoying the game. Will say you need a really good phone to play it. I play both pc and android version and it's really great to have with me on the go.,Positive,194,41

Vayne Aurelius,2020-10-29 02:14:48,The only problem is the voice actor and the sentences they said sometimes does not match. Sometimes they said the next sentence.,Positive,128,22

Arjo Mejilla,2020-11-09 14:47:17,"Beautiful world, characters, and magic! An amazing time alone, and even more wonderful in co-op mode. :D My buddy and I played tag when we got tired of defeating bosses hahaha",Positive,175,31
Quentin Ward,2020-11-12 04:31:34,Brilliant game with amazing story. And you genuinely don't have to pay for anything just keep playing and you'll be amazed at the all the different content,Positive,155,27
Lyn Zap,2020-11-11 07:12:01,"an exceptional game, its even more amazing that its free. i have lots of fun playing even without paying because you can build the free characters to be good.",Positive,158,29
Friendly Nosk,2020-11-13 19:21:03,"I love this game!! Its fun, some of the game mechanics is abit confusing like trying to find a way to show more of the unknown lacotion or how to teleport by waypoint",Positive,166,33
Asian ‚Ä¢ Berry,2020-11-13 19:25:35,"I have really been loving my experience so far with the graphics, game play and everything it has to offer although I'm still getting used to everything I can proudly say that this is a game worth playingüëèüëè",Positive,206,38
Brandon Fietek,2020-11-15 23:58:31,"Well designed game with plenty of exploration, quests, and events to keep one occupied. Isn't repetitive, also includes crafting which is a huge plus.",Positive,150,24
Jamar Foster,2020-11-15 16:12:23,Nice game with great graphics and a good story line. My only wish is for the game is tohave more powers with your main character. To use,Positive,136,27
Angel Deguzman,2020-10-23 17:05:02,"It's pretty great game. I play this game in a few weeks now and I enjoy every quest. Especially the combat system, it's pretty amazing. I like the element reacting to other element, it makes the gameplay really interesting. So far so good, the characters are amazingly detailed and different from each other. Really glad to download this game.",Positive,343,59
Brandi Gentry-Dunn,2020-10-25 15:44:01,So far absolutely love this game. Reminds me of when I first got Zelda Breath of the Wild on the switch. Beautiful console quality graphics and open world gameplay on mobile devices. When I started playing I immediately switched over to my iPad to be able to appreciate the graphics better. Not to say you can't play on your phone. Its my new favorite game to play.,Positive,365,67
Hendrick Lee,2020-10-22 17:41:52,"Good storyline, great graphics, even greater game play. Loot boxes are reasonable, where you are sure to get a 4-star and above loot for every 10 draws (even when doing it 1 by 1), and in game rewards you for playing with loads of currency for the loot boxes. It is a change from the regular money grabbing RPG, and its no pressure game play coupled with a real open world roaming makes it a refreshing change from those games where you have to join a guild. Not for ultra competitive gamers though.",Positive,499,93
Xayful Malik,2020-10-28 14:20:33,"I've played the game for quite some times now, around 20-ish hour. Overall, there's no reason for me not to give this a 5/5 star. But I know the dev very well, and since the system was very similar with HI3, (resin as your stamina, primogems as your in-game currency, and wish as your gatcha system), I bet the long-term playthrough experience won't be as blasting as for now. In fact, it might be a flip from 5 to 3.",Positive,417,80
Amii Lee,2020-11-05 09:46:30,Love it! Amazing graphics and beautiful story line and characters only thing I'm sad about is not being able to pat the cats and dogs in the towns,Positive,146,28
Necromancer101 fahreza,2020-11-02 00:21:17,Good game but getting primogem is hard and the chances of getting 5 star hero is slim. After 70 or 60 standard draw and still no 5 star hero or weapon. But the game is nice.,Positive,173,36
Kindred,2020-11-10 22:59:07,"This game is too good to be true! I absolutely enjoying this. The adventure theme, OST, plus the plot story makes this game more addictive! #mihoyo please do something about gamepads for mobile!!!!!",Positive,198,33
sebastian teguh,2020-10-18 22:15:48,"The best RPG so far, single player is fun, multi player is better, has an intersting story line, open world free roaming. I can't believe this is free. And we can play multi player between platform, including PC and PS4!!! The only problem I notice sofl far is the controller, it's fixed button. So I often move the character into the wrong direction. But it's a minor problem really",Positive,383,69
Banana,2020-11-05 15:27:14,"I absolutely love this game. A bit bumped about how you need to get dupes to fully max out the potential of a character through constellation, but it's definitely f2p!",Positive,167,30
Zen YourFutureBoyfriend,2020-11-07 18:04:09,"I actually like the game, plot and game movementa are easy and the characters are a lot of fun, sometimes grinding is a bit hard but going off on guests are a lot of fun",Positive,169,35
Rylle Klee,2020-10-31 04:21:59,"OMG this game is soooo relaxing! The story is stunning, the graphics and the soundtrack are to die for and the handles are just right.",Positive,134,25
craig suarez,2020-11-04 11:43:59,I love this game 10/10. I suggest that we should remove fast travel except the ones in the city or any main places so that we can add mounts in the game like horse or perhaps a flying mount in order for us to travel around. Just look at the view of the game it's so beautiful and yet we can't appreciate all the details because of fast travel. My last suggestion is to add hunger level in the game so that we will gather foods in the wild not just because of buffs but because we need to.,Positive,488,99
Daniel Young,2020-11-03 16:46:43,"Amazing game, good fun on a daily basis, graphics are beautiful, but even better with better hardware and the character design is better then most anime.",Positive,153,26

Joy Fabel,2020-11-02 08:36:30,"Love it so much, honestly a lot of content for no money. i would've gladly played 20 eu ans I'm pretty sure they could have asked 40 from most people. Thanks for this little gift",Positive,178,35
Tashil Mahabeer,2020-11-04 03:53:59,"I just started but it really seems like an amazing RPG with an interesting story to follow, but also enough freedom to explore the game how I want .",Positive,148,29
kym,2020-10-31 02:36:26,I actually really enjoy this game. I am someone who gets bored of games easily. I would get rid of them in less than a week. But Genshin Impact is different. I can play the ge casually without getting obsessed to the point where i might end up losing interest easily. Its a game i can play frequently and enjoying it the same each time. Its the only game that I've played for this long. Its a wonderful game with beautiful visuals. I also love the element based powers and their reactions.,Positive,489,92
Levi Walker,2020-11-04 10:45:50,"This is probably the least pay to win gacha game ever. Sure if you pay money you will get stuff quicker, but you can easily keep up with paid players without buying anything.",Positive,174,33
Meji,2020-10-30 10:31:16,Hard to believe its a free to play game. Really looking forward for the coming updates!! Though I wish we would get a little more Resin to play around with.,Positive,156,30
Lo Saechao,2020-10-30 18:16:45,Haven't gotten that far into the game but it's great so far. Everything you would expect from an open world RPG. Only complaint that I do have is the triggers in the bottom right are a bit too centered on the screen. Every time I go to toggle the camera I accidentally hit the attack or jump button. There's more than enough room to move those triggers a bit more to the right to prevent this.,Positive,393,76
Muhammad Nazreen,2020-11-01 08:00:33,"Lost for words on how great this is. Best first impression, good gameplay, interesting element combination system, great story line so far.",Positive,139,22
Angel Harvey,2020-11-08 18:16:05,Impressive graphics and the challenges are mentally challenging sometimes. Hope more guides for all the quests instead of searching it on youtube. But overall i love playing this game,Positive,183,29
Thinesh Prathaban,2020-10-29 21:56:38,"I wish they can link my ps4 save to mobile but cant blame the developer because the restrictions are on psn account. Overall its a wonderful game, there are no pay to win concept in this game.",Positive,192,37
Kameron Brown,2020-11-08 21:17:06,"This may be a discount Breath of the Wild, but it is fun, all things considered! I also find it to be more happy and upbeat than BOTW.",Positive,134,28
3R1C 29,2020-11-08 19:24:35,"I like the game feature,story,collecting things,hunting treasure or things,big map,graphic,tactical and logic its 100/100 this will be the game of the year!!",Positive,157,22
Afzal Haris,2020-11-11 09:25:13,"Never expected a game of this level when I saw it first but it proved me wrong with unlimited freedom to roam around and open chests hunt bosses and mobs and my favorite,puzzles.",Positive,178,33
XselorYZ ShadowWalker,2020-11-11 15:11:18,I'll give this one a 5 but i can't tell my opinion for now. This game really is nostalgic and has the most perfect mechanic for open world adventuring with a twist of anime gacha character styles and art,Positive,203,39
Sofwan,2020-11-15 09:55:22,Nice game. But there's bug when i was doing my leyline. It should be 7 enemies but I only found 6 so I can't accept the reward. Can you please fix it?,Positive,150,32
jeremiah lugtu,2020-10-27 16:43:46,The only thing holding this back is the absurdly low gacha rates and poor stamina system. Make no mistake this is a gacha game first and foremost. Currently not a lot of content after rank 30/35 but with clear communication and a detailed roadmap it doesn't matter. You can go by completely free to play I've reached the end-game content (for now) and can honestly say there is no paywall whatsoever! If you do decide to spend for gacha (basically gambling but for anime girls/guys). Spend wisely!,Positive,497,87
Taigan 88,2020-10-26 22:37:01,"This game is just perfect, the graphics, the story, the characters, everything. But the bad side is you have to have a good phone to play the game properly, there are actually a low graphics definition but I highly recommend you to play in high definition to have the full experience, but besides that this game is very worth playing.",Positive,334,60
eh ?,2020-11-01 17:34:53,"Great game! A few bugs tho, like one of my enemies were invisible and the lines aren't in sync with the animation.",Positive,114,22
Amirul Danial,2020-11-01 00:23:23,"Excellent storyline, perhaps you could provide us a free 'wish' for maybe once a day to give us better experience. I know this is a gacha game, but give us some hope is not wrong anyways.",Positive,187,36
Dan Scrub,2020-10-23 09:17:03,"Fantastic game overall, only issue I really have is the reward/energy/coop system. The game feels really stingy with the event/achievement rewards. For example, the first event gave less than 2 single pulls, and you need to do an average of 125 achievements to do a single 10 pull. The energy is pretty lacking, which limits coop play severely. Small gripes for me, but others seem to be really mad about them. The gacha rate is better than it seems, and the gameplay/design/voices are just amazing.",Positive,499,85
[AWP]Spytonio2006,2020-10-21 20:29:05,"Probably best game out there right now on mobile. It is free, with enough grinding and a bit of luck you are able to get every character maxed out even as a F2P. Tons of content, a big map that will hopefully be extended with more Statues of the Seven, like Electro, Cryo etc. It runs somewhat smooth on mobile too. The only thing I don't like about it is that there is no PS4 cross-save, though I understand that is because of contracts and things. Great job mihoyo, Tech otakus will save the world",Positive,499,95
Arash HN,2020-11-07 22:41:40,This is by FAR the best anime game currently out there and one of the best open-world RPGs. I never thought something this great would be free to play and guess what? The game is pretty rewarding if you actually play and grind in it. The story is very well-written and engaging and the gameplay specially fighting section is very addictive and well-made. Yes it has loot boxes (in the form of Wishes) but you will always feel satisfied even if you never open one. 103/10 would recommend!,Positive,487,88
KuRaSou Yo,2020-10-26 09:43:24,"Updating my rating, seems they are becoming more generous to non-payers. The resources tho (like exp material) still a bit grindy, and the resin is the only problem, also add android touch setup since the controls is a bit annoying. But as of now the game is top-tier, and I am waiting for the next update for more content. I am so satisfied, and am giving a deserving 5 star, and willing to tell this to my friends. Top tier game in your pocket...",Positive,448,84
Z9machine 01,2020-11-13 09:17:44,"Amazing game, i love this game and cant wait for its future updates hope it doesnt become a pay to win game as its kinda looking toward that direction, lets hope not though!!",Positive,174,33
Vincentius Onny Hendra,2020-11-10 17:06:04,"Please add changable outfits for our characters and let us change their appearances as well. At least for the main character. So we can enjoy the game as our own self, not the character the developer set how we have to looks like.",Positive,230,43
emmanuel cantor,2020-11-11 12:08:53,Genshin impact really gives you freedom/time on how you work on your po progress. They dont force you to do any event in a set time. So its a great game for a busy player who want to enjoy the game,Positive,197,41
Fernando Yodo,2020-11-02 14:56:30,"Pleas update for more combat feature, such as aerial combo, another combo other than the original one's. Hoping for a better improvement in the future for this game.",Positive,165,28
Zeir √ò,2020-11-07 15:48:55,"Really good game, The game graphics itself is not a lie like other most of RPG open world games. I'm looking forward to your good updates in the future.",Positive,152,29
Just a Guy on the Internet L U,2020-11-04 11:38:19,It works perfectly fine the graphics are great except for the video and audio clips part on the story lines it lags as hell whenever a story line based clip shows up fix that ;-; pls,Positive,182,36
Christian Wood,2020-10-30 21:58:29,My wife didn't really game but enjoyed playing this game! I know I sure like the story and combat myself. Definitely a game worth putting some money into.,Positive,154,28
Cruptus G,2020-11-02 17:42:41,"Love the game please don't add more in game purchases etc and spoil the game, make the game as it is based on skill and curiosity.Update the game with extension of the maps and new monsters quests and please do add factions and quests with factions etc.üíó thank you for this game",Positive,278,52

Rozaldo Dimanalata,2020-11-01 14:30:04,"great, the graphics is excellent nonetheless the gameplay and elemental reaction in the battlefield are unexpected, hoping for new map, characters and smooth gameplay at the nexrt update.",Positive,187,28
Frisk,2020-11-01 11:32:50,"This is good game I've played so far, but i do have problem when facing opponent from an unevent terrain where the camera constanly lowered itself on ground level making me hard to see whats going on",Positive,199,37
Ghosty,2020-11-01 20:40:52,Amazing!i love this gamr but it does seem a bit laggy to be honest so why not put a graphics quality so we can stop the lags and thanks for making this game have a great day!!,Positive,175,37
Glados92,2020-11-02 20:37:09,Probably the best open world game in the play store. No lags or ping issues either. Everything is great. Devs really did a good job.,Positive,132,25
Hannah Hooper,2020-11-03 12:54:03,"Graphics, art, and sounds are amazing. Open world rivals Breath of the Wild. Great fight mechanics. You can literally use magic. Lore is intriguing as well.",Positive,156,26
James Hannon,2020-11-11 18:33:12,Best OPEN WORLD phone game I have played. It is GATCHA when it comes to getting new characters but I dont mind because the game is BEAUTIFUL. 5 STARS for now. Very nice to have on phone. Haven't tried it on console yet. I RECOMMEND giving this game a chance. Very nice so far.,Positive,276,54

Simon Paradis,2020-11-15 04:40:25,"Quite good exploration, it is however a gatcha game, don't put all your money on it, you'll need a lot of luck or over 4k$to max out a character",Positive,144,29
Gabriel P K,2020-11-11 21:44:17,"honeslty this game is soo fantastic. Everything from the combat to the immersion is absolutely amazing, then you take in the fact that you're playing this on your phone, there is no game out there with the same level of detail.",Positive,227,41
Jan Matsumoto,2020-11-11 11:51:36,Pretty Similar to the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild but was able to make it original. I enjoyed it alot. Probably addicted to it now.,Positive,138,27
C. B.,2020-10-18 17:02:40,"Good graphics, good combat. it's a bit laggy at times on my samsung a50, but working mostly fine. Loading time to title screen takes a long time sometimes. What I found kind of bothering was when trying to jump on platforms. If you could please fix this. Trying to maneuver the character to the next moving platform in temples when playing mobile feels a bit heavy. Overall a good game tho.",Positive,390,71
Dante Stanford,2020-10-26 23:32:49,"I love this game from the open world to the mechanics it's so addicting and fun a great time killer and the gatcha system works well, it's a little laggy at times during cutscenes and it doesn't really feel like the whole experience is there yet but it's new so I will give it the benefit of the doubt overall a great game compared to other games like this one.",Positive,361,70
Luke Six,2020-10-28 04:56:53,"I never write reviews for games,but this game I'll make an exception. Let's start with the fact that it's free. This game seems to good to be free but it is. The graphics are great,storyline is good,and overall just an amazing game. Although if you don't have a good phone to run it, it will run bad but that is my only complaint. This game definitely deserves five stars.",Positive,372,69
Sumit Parab,2020-10-22 11:45:56,"Rating it 5 because of graphics, game play and all the other features, a huge open world where we can roam and farm as much possible.... Loved absolutely everything of this and indeed it takes lot of effort to create such pleasure and provide us. Con: heats up the phone due to massive usage of battery .hope so this can be solved. Thankyou for everything. New: had to remove due to heating issues and also usage of battery.",Positive,424,78
Donny Zhu,2020-10-21 10:11:57,"Super amazing, graphics are super good. The story is amazing, you are a person ig that can travel between worlds, but when you come to his world u can't leave, so u find a way to leave. When you and your sibling try to leave, you get separated. (Pick the male mc because apparently there have been some voice lines where it points to a more male oriented mc) The combat is smooth but different, completely different from botw. You can switch between different characters to get elemental combos.",Positive,495,89
Ronjay Bernardo,2020-11-11 08:36:51,"Awesome graphics and gameplay with interesting stories to unfold while adventuring in an open world. Also, it has hint of HI3 gameplay but in an open world.",Positive,156,27
zabi,2020-10-21 01:37:06,"A PC player here, never played the mobile cause I'm used to the game big monitor. But I'll just say, as progressing through the game as a AR 33 player the amount of content and exploration this game has to offer is enormous, the story is interesting and the characters are wobbly and actually feels like a person due to their own side story mission, I've played decent amount of RPG games all I can say is, genshin impact is my first MMORPG that I can call ""fun"".",Positive,463,88
Jiaqi Wang,2020-10-21 13:05:41,"Great game play, absolutely love this game, grinding it for a week and already finished main story. Bad thing is the wish system, the rates for dropping 5 stars ar ridiculously low, for free to play players, this game is not fun after rank 30. Even if you get some 4 stars, you need duplicates to actually make them good, which isn't always garenteed. I am complaining but they probs won't listen, this game is a money grabber, good game but trash for free to play",Positive,464,86
**Stella Nix**,2020-11-05 00:48:41,"I don't usually write reviews bt this is one of the most amazing f2p game I have ever played the music, graphics, the storyline characters everything is amazing.",Positive,161,28
Joe Calvin,2020-10-22 18:45:53,"Its the best open world game I've ever played, but I think you need to improve or do something about the resin. Somehow like if our adventure level is up, it will fill the resin. Because I think the resin is very important because if you need to open chest after beat the boss, you need a lot of resin and it will only get 1 resin every 8 minutes, thats quite long time, I hope that we could create a guild and having guild raid.Thanks for your attention, keep improving~",Positive,471,91
Sabrina,2020-10-26 09:03:11,"I preregistered for this after playing Honkai Impact for around 2 years and I am not disappointed! As someone you cannot afford a console or video games, this is the best game I've ever played and the closest I've ever gotten to playing a console game. Compared to other mobile games, this actually looks good, is super interesting and doesn't get boring after a month! I hope more games like this will be available for mobile in the future; this game makes mobile gaming not a total mockery!",Positive,492,88
Heeyy 0527,2020-11-11 09:16:01,"It's really amazing game. I love it, I hope this game can be more better and better. But i hope the ping can be stabilized in asia region üòä",Positive,139,29
Crashicle,2020-10-25 08:28:08,"As an avid fan of RPG and gacha games, this game hits the spot. A lot to adventure and it is still only 2 out of the 7 total regions. Each character is unique and has their own play style (except Amber, pls buff Amber). A bit grindy and the resources that are given for those grinds are a bit tedious and slow. But overall, really good game for an f2p game.",Positive,357,72
Nate,2020-11-01 00:28:55,"So fun, I can't believe this is free to play. There is so much to do. The only thing I wish there was more of is things to do co op with friends.",Positive,145,33

mohamad Aqil Izzuddin,2020-11-02 00:42:03,"Best f2p game that's as close to zelda botw as you can get. Great graphics and content updates every 6 weeks. But beware as this game can make even high end phones heat up like an oven due to the intense resources used. Can sync progress to pc client too. If you have bad luck or a gambling addiction, stay away from the gacha as it might land you in a bad spot. They give a few rolls at the start but that's it. Overall, amazing stuff mihoyo. Just stop being stingy with them primogems.",Positive,487,95

shimm alque,2020-11-10 01:12:16,Great game I'm adv rank 40 with f2p and the game is amazing there is no need to spend any money in this game. Everyone rating this game because they can't get what they want is ridiculous they don't force you to pay and there isn't any pay wall to jump over. Game runs amazing on my Android phone just stay away from Samsung terrible phones lol. One plus for life. The game is beautiful with alot to do. Also they aren't even close to being done. For a free game that can be played for free 5 star,Positive,497,99

vipin r nair,2020-11-11 20:53:48,"The game is sooo good. BUT dor every update you release, why we have to reinstall game from the beginning? Installing 6 gb of game everytime after an update is not feasible. Look into that matter.",Positive,196,36
Nikith Pai,2020-11-11 12:43:01,This is one of the best games I've ever played it's got a great story for single player and a Co-op mode for multiplayer the only thing I'm worried about is that my phone might run out of storage to install this awesome game,Positive,224,44

Thank You so much Genshin Impact creators for such an amazing game.,Positive,363,64
Sai Eswar,2020-10-24 01:00:48,"Wonderful anime based game. I thoroughly enjoyed it a lot. Good graphics. Even low graphic setting is fine for us and also there are normal, high, highest. Its cool and i have never seen such a good graphic game in Android. I strongly recommend this game to you guys. But you should have good gaming phone. 6gb ram is perfect for playing without lag. I also wanted know the name of anime on which this game is based on...........",Positive,429,79
Cristina Iliescu,2020-10-21 17:55:02,"Literally the best game i have ever played on phone! Map is absolutely hugely and open world, plenty stuff to explore, smart ways to fight, controls are comfortable and, shockingly, you dont seen to need to pay money to actually enjoy the game! It doesnt give the ""greedy developer"" feel at all, its incredible for me that it doesn't cost anything to download. Thank you so much developers for this cool game, im hooked! *characters voices and chats not repetitive and professional, greatstoryline",Positive,497,83
Cheese Is Grate,2020-11-11 13:32:23,"Extremely fun, amazing story, unbelievable graphics. The only problem (but might only be my internet or phone) is that it lags nonstop which makes it much harder to kill and climb/move around. The stamina and damage taken still go at normal speed but movement speed is limited. The skill cooldowns also goes much slower but time challenges go at regular speed. That makes the challenges almost impossible. If you can fix it, this game would literally be perfect :) otherwise I still recommend 99.99%!",Positive,500,84
Zakaria EL KRAA,2020-10-27 04:12:16,"This is the best game i ever played on Android , it gives me Nintendo games vibe and i enjoy it a lot , also im quite addicted to it , i hope they can make the online stuff ( co-op ) more interesting , like battling ur friends or something .

Jordan Fluegel,2020-10-22 09:21:15,"Really well done mobile game that is better than most console games. Really fun, open world, with actual fighting tactics using different elemental combinations. Only issue is some frame rate slowdowns that don't fix themselves without exiting the game. It takes a long time to first load up, but loading is miniscule after. One recommendation is to have more variety of weapon drops as I have not changed weapons because I've only ever seen one purple one gifted to you.",Positive,471,80

Aditya Kashyap,2020-10-25 01:27:56,"I really enjoyed this game, the game developer did a great job and iam really really impressed by the graphics. I never expected that such game graphics will be ever seen in mobile and it provides console level graphics in mobile, which is the part I love most. I hope more games like this will be develop in future by the game developer, have so much expectations.",Positive,365,67
Callaghan Patrick,2020-10-21 09:13:10,I love how the designers have given deep thought into the aesthetic appeal of the environment and individuality to the characters. A lot of hard work has been done in creating the story lines and the literature of mini story books have given it an awesome sense adventure. The intense action packs off with a wonderful warm up background music and later tones down to a very subtle and calming music which fits perfectly with the environment. The open world experience of this game is magical!,Positive,493,86
King Kai Fist !!!,2020-10-26 03:32:05,"Amazing, since I have a lot of things to do I can get on and quickly do dailies and use my resin. The elemental system is an amazing addition to make the game better. The promised future area make the prospect of this game truly a great one. Resin is a problem for people maybe make the rate of resin 1 per 7 minutes that would make a huge difference. The gacha is needed for a great free game. Overall one of the best mobile games of all time just from this because of the effort put in to the start",Positive,500,101
gibson X,2020-11-03 10:54:00,"Last time i give 1 star cuz they didnt gimme any 5 star hero. Tell you what, i changed my mind. Gameplay, graphic, music soundtrack all at its very best in this kind of game's genre. Bugs are relative, coop is okay, boss battles are the main course of this game. Sadly there is resin/energy system that limit your character's development. However you can still roam the world as you like but given with small exp as a rewards.",Positive,426,79

Arturas Nesakysiu,2020-10-27 10:36:36,"This is one of the very few mobile games I am willing to give a 5 star to AND without even being asked to do a vote. Every content is very much doable without paying a single penny, I didnt experience any adds, graphocs are nice and well optimized it runs smooth on my 300$ phone, english dub is amazing (tried japanese too its also great) controls are not too clunky despite needing to use a joystick. The only thing im dissattisfied mostly is with how ""Resin"" works but they are trying to change.",Positive,498,94
Tom Brennan,2020-10-22 11:59:48,"This game is setting the bar for cross platform and cross compatibility. I'm able to go from my pc to my iPad, to my note 20 ultra with the same save. Gorgeous open world, great story, and fun combat. Downside is the gacha aspect, but they are generous with the currency - just save it all for a specific banner pull. Puzzles and mini games are an added touch",Positive,359,69
Rahul Gamer,2020-10-26 21:04:20,"Over all mind-blowing game.. The controls , the game play . For an Android game it's just amazing..

Journey Cross,2020-10-23 00:25:42,"I've been playing it on PC and this is a great game. I love the characters, the story, and the world. It's like a breath of the wild game that can be played on your phone. People may say ""It's a Zelda BOTW clone."" Which if you play it, you'll see it's not true. You can see the similarities, that's it. Give it try, you might like it!",Positive,334,68
Vertexion,2020-10-24 21:37:25,"At first I was doubtful, since I never played this kind of game before but after downloading it I can't stop Playing, The character designs are very beautiful.

Animan,2020-10-25 18:45:06,"Gameplay is awesome. But there is a problem with headphones. If I connect my headphone & open the game, it works fine.

Tyasha,2020-10-26 14:31:23,"This game is awesome! The fact that this game is literally ad free plus amazing graphics and character designs! The areas and maps are gorgeous, I can see that a lot of time and effort has been put into developing this game. Ya'll saying that the resin is way too less blah blah, how hard is it to wait a few hours? People need to learn time management and enjoy the game! The gacha is a bit unfair though, I can agree with that. I personally think this is a great game and people are too impatient.",Positive,499,97
Muhammad Aryo Setyo Bimantoro,2020-10-23 17:27:03,"The gameplay are really amazing. But, please increase the gacha rate for 5 stars character. All of my freind got it when they are under AR 20. I've already reached AR 26, but I haven't got 5 star character or weapon. I'm very satisfied with the gameplay. All I hope is just the gacha rate increased.

Has a decent story, a fun gameplay(tho there's no lock on enemy), rich with secrets, and especially the graphics is mesmerizing for sure. And for the gacha is not that Important for now(well I dunno what'll happen for the future). So It's suppose to be 8.5/Zelda from me",Positive,343,63
Mortal Peace,2020-10-18 12:38:42,"This game is amazing! The graphics, the story, the characters; everything! I can't stop playing it! However, I think some features can be added to better the experience. I suggest you include a trading system between players. Another thing I heard from a friend is that the enemies' levels be averaged with the party's rather than adventure rank. Finally, another thing to include is a chat log in case if the player misses any important dialogue.",Positive,447,76
Ian Anthony Wijono,2020-10-19 22:27:25,"Overall, it is one of the best game I have ever played.

Akif Hafie,2020-10-19 12:36:38,"Ya know when game devs say something like ""the future of mobile gaming"", this is exactly what I thought of. Instead of being a pure mobile rpg, it feels more like a ps4 game that got ported over to the mobile, and it's absolutely fantastic. I don't mind getting lambasted with game ads if the game being advertised is actually as good as this. Unlike that other annoying cash grab game that rhymes with Paid Widow Peasant",Positive,421,77

Derrick Ada,2020-10-22 07:48:10,"Very addictive , in a good way it feels like a breath of the wild expansion. The game so far does not feel like a pay to win. After quite a few hours of gameplay I have not needed to store at all. I happily bought a pass from the store though. The storyline is solid and has voice-over. The only downside so far is the adventure rank system. It is not much of a downside but it levels kind of slow. The game needs costumes to and an easy way to talk to other players online. These are minor issues.",Positive,498,101
Literally Jesus,2020-10-28 13:49:50,"This is probably the best mobile game out right now.

Eon,2020-10-27 22:07:18,"This game is straight up impressive for a mobile game, perhaps even raising the bar. It's an open world rpg with many activities to distract you along the way. There's no ads, no intrusive pop-ups to buy stuff, none of the annoying pushing microtransactions every day. There is a store but it only has premium currency, which I still don't know the purpose of after two days of playing. They do a really good job of NOT making it feel like a mobile game. It is very much worth the try.",Positive,485,91
Reed,2020-10-25 21:43:56,"Incredible game with stunning graphics. The combat mechanics are very fun and fast-paced. The game world is very Zelda-like in style, and it's bursting with loot to grab and bosses to take down. PC cross-save is super convenient for me too. I've spent about 25 hrs playing and have spent money for some characters but didn't feel like I had to, which is nice (and rare).",Positive,370,66
James Rimer,2020-10-18 01:03:34,Fantastic in depth open world game with so much to do if you manage your resources right. The Resin resource seems to refill about 2x a day but I wish they just doubled the cap with the same daily total so you could do twice as much in one go. There are also gatcha elements for the characters but you can stay free to play if you desire and the game will give you enough primogems for several character pulls as you play through the story! Overall its one of the best free to play games I've seen!,Positive,498,98
KABAL Dalo,2020-10-21 17:55:26,Listen I've played many phone games but this one takes the cake you'll never get bored with the amount of content this game has its also cross platform so you can play on your play station and computer aswell you really don't need to spend money on this game because of how many ways you can get currency just by regularly playing so pick this game up and enjoy!,Positive,362,69
Myriam Derome,2020-10-27 14:36:50,"Can't say using a phone for this is optimal, but as someone who's about to hit AR40 on my psn account this game is an absolutely addictive blast, and the first time I've ever spent money on a ""free to play"" game. God that lack of crossplay hurts though. Also my one big piece of advice is to chill out about progression speed. You do NOT need to buy resin to pass the battle pass objectives thanks to event exp, and there's literally 1550 chests, so grinding adventure exp by domain is also stupid.",Positive,498,94
Meh Player,2020-10-23 13:25:10,"I love this game, it's hard to come across a game that balances things so well. The only advice I would give, would be to make primograms a bit more available for Free to play players. For instance at times it takes an hour or more just to do one summon. It's not that I don't like the grind, I would grind on games for hours, however when you grind for hours just so the rewards not to be so rewarding of the time you have invested it's a bit upsetting. But so far the game is fantastic!",Positive,488,98
LT Gaming,2020-10-22 06:47:50,"I love this game! It's a great game to play on mobile, pc or consoles. I've played since it opened and I can't get enough, the fact that it will keep updating make me feel I will never get enough of it. The only drawback is the resin, you waste to much and get back too little, I under stand if you pay you get more, but even so, I feel it's to expensive in-game to get resin probably setting it to 80/60resin permanent would be great!",Positive,435,87
Rakeless2020,2020-10-27 03:03:46,"At only level 8, I have unlocked so many characters through the story alone and unlike many games similar to this you genuinely can get any of the materials used in their gacha/loot box system by simply playing the side quests exploring the vast and expansive, beautifully animated map. There are hidden dungeons, unlockable areas, mini puzzles and much more! I really have been addicted to it, the tutorial even teaches you about different anemo available and lets you try some characters out free.",Positive,499,84
Timothy O'Brien,2020-10-25 07:01:08,"This game kind of reminds me of Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and I love it. It's a really great open world game with a lot of action. There's a lot of awesome characters, the story is really interesting, and the game gives you something to do every day. The best part about this game is that it's free to play on both mobile and Playstation. So check it out and have fun playing!",Positive,385,76
David Eichler,2020-10-19 21:25:06,"Great game Android phones don't last long with this game. P20 pro and galaxy s8 both die in under 2 hr. Graphics, controls, and gameplay are decent, although no Bluetooth controller support(that probly kill the battery faster anyways) This game is one of the most entertaining games I've played since botw came out. I am playing this primarily on the ps4 now though because of heat and battery issues. Thanks for the hard work developers, hopefully bugs get worked out in Android version as well",Positive,495,85
hypro escalier,2020-10-26 20:01:23,"This game is really good but the story is not inviting, I suggest you should add a narrator to summarize what's happening so we could at least understand it a bit, otherwise we would only be into the gameplay apart from your stories because most players will skip the dialog and they say they're awful and annoying to listen... I play it on mostly in pc, it's very laggy on my phone even though it's 4g ram with all graphics low. please optimize for low-end devices so I can play without lag ty",Positive,494,93
Dustin Fowler,2020-10-23 09:23:45,"The game is great. I can see myself playing it for a long, long time. I've never played Breath of the Wild, but this game is fantastic. It's a gacha, which I don't mind. It literally is a console game, which brings me to my only gripe: where's the controller support on mobile? Players on PC and ps4 have it already, so seems easy to do. I'd also love to see the game on Stadia, which would let me play anywhere. The game is great!",Positive,431,85
Damian Lamie,2020-10-27 04:14:08,"Amazing cut scenes, great visuals, fun and relaxing gameplay, wonderful music, great voice acting, and much more. We finally made it! A AAA mobile game worth playing casually, lots of hours of free fun on the go. If you are like me, you will want to buy something in game as thanks for such a wondeful product. In a world full of aggressively marketed ""freemium"" games, Genshin Impact is a breath of fresh air that deserves your time, and if you feel like it your money. Thank you to the developers!",Positive,499,91
Khylo Ren,2020-11-01 09:29:23,I think this is overall a great game with surprisingly great quality and audio. Good sustainable content that will leave you playing all day until you seeze that satisfaction. And the best part is the art enthusiastically excites you althoughout the game with memorizing colours and aesthetics. Good game to play for those who would love to try out an MMORPG/RPG game!,Positive,368,62
keith neumeyer,2020-10-26 22:39:15,"Great story, very engaging, if you try this game dont give up on it till you've gotten the first story quest done the game picks up in speed quite a bit after, upgrading characters and gear is easy and their is a bit of grind involved that doesn't feel like a hassle with a healthy amount of world lore. Noticed an issue with an achievement, recently i got the daily commission to play pirates with the 3 little kids on the ship, I was not credited the achievement for playing pirate with them",Positive,493,93
Michal Babinec,2020-10-29 05:11:00,"By downloading this game, you give yourself: Open world adventure game with NO ADS... You don't have to grind all day to get to the point of late game. Game that is so good, you'll feel bad for not spending any money (because payment here is optional). One of the best mobile games I have played.",Positive,296,56
Brandon Martin,2020-10-30 07:29:56,I just did a system update with this device and now the sound quality is incredibly static and laggy which makes it painful to hear most things in the game. Please fix,Positive,167,32
dominic nukz,2020-11-11 08:02:55,"great game , but the resins system is harder and harder when you reach ar 40 up , you need to refix the resins system each boss and ley lines have their resins cost system like if i go in mora ley lines the cost will be 10 resins only",Positive,234,50
Kazu ken,2020-10-28 16:41:20,Great Game realy love it . The story line is great . The caracrors voice is also great . It takes maximum 7 GB rom but it it wroth it . You can do a lot of free roming in this game . This is the best open world game I ever played. The controls are so simple and very easy to understand. The more you unoco the new caractor the more you can adventure the world . The Developers are great. The game graphics are super .,Positive,417,88
Zerlina Hafidz,2020-10-17 23:20:51,"The only rpg that I'm addicted with, I love the graphics, the characters, and the story. I also love how I could you explore the world. One thing that I really want is that maybe allow us to play with friends with different servers? and then we could freely change servers without deleting our progress. Other than that, this is a fantastic game. Looking forward to play more!",Positive,376,68
MUHAMMAD FADLI AIMAN BIN MOHD ZHILAL,2020-11-04 21:38:38,"This game is really cool and dope, i really like the graphic in this game. It's really feel like playing Legend of Zelda on nintendo switch. But please fix the server on Asia.",Positive,175,33
Tabatha Christie,2020-10-26 09:06:11,"It's all super fun and reminds me of Zelda as well as Sword Art Online. It has fun tasks, awesome characters, full voiced scenes, and even interesting story pieces as you carry along in the storyline. And frequent new updates with more awesome characterson the way! It may be large and burn up battery power on my phone, but I am in love!",Positive,338,63

Tyrone Paat,2020-10-30 15:46:50,"Open world game packed with a nice control and gameplay filled with a great story to add, with the crossplay feature makes this game more fun with no worry of affecting solo play as there's no PVP and can do PVE activity with friends. Gacha isn't that good in here, as every game with a gacha feature never be good, and some currency that needs to be more optimized as some type of players struggle with it. But as long as you try enjoy the game with your own pace, there's no wall to worry about.",Positive,497,96
Coolzebra Gaming,2020-10-29 20:56:22,It gives me breath of the wild vibes and its really cool. So far the story is very amaizing and the quests gives the player a chance to explore the world better,Positive,160,32

The only issue I have is if the controls can be annoying if you're on a phone with a smaller screen but that aside its great. The setting is interesting, the character designs and voices are good, there's plenty of lore to read over too.",Positive,297,57
Kostadin Dimov,2020-11-03 16:33:38,"Story, art, gameplay .... and its free. Just enjoy it and dont be bothered by not having a 5* char or weapon. At some point you will only to find out 4* chars are also great and enjoyable to play.",Positive,196,40

Akiruoo,2020-10-19 02:28:08,"The game itself is pretty good! I recommend it to lots of people. It takes certain aspects of other games and transforms it into its own thing, its quite hard to describe how. The problem is when you go to certain places, it starts lagging alot for some reason. I also cannot even get to the loading screen anymore because I keep getting kicked out of the app. UPDATE: To fix the bug, you should put other apps to sleep or uninstall then reinstall the app again.",Positive,462,87
Cheng Vue,2020-10-21 03:47:11,"Pretty nice, I play on the comp, and everything about this game is great, and has a little everything for everyone, if you have any doubts about this game just look at the review statistics. Usually 1 star reviews are higher than 2 stars on most mobile games, but this game doesn't have that, which shows just how great the game is.

I primarily play on PC but it's a luxury to play where I left off on my phone. The game does require an active connection, but it's not a problem over LTE since it's not in need of instant input.

Only problem I can think of is character selection. Too me it seemed like I could get multiple people instead of the 4 I already have. It let's you play other characters during some story missions but there is no way to keep those characters or buy them. I might just not be at an high enough level yet or missing something.",Positive,481,94

Dexter shep,2020-10-19 00:38:12,"This game is great the map is very beautiful, control is pretty solid except aiming with bow is sometimes akward if targeting fast enemies, and there is an audio glitch that turn the game into 8 bit horror game, and i minimized the game temporarily to make it gone, but sometimes it still appear, and hoping there will be more easy way to get primogem, if it mean i have to farm it, and please add controller support, and please add girl x girl romance like kiana and mei in honkai impact",Positive,488,92
Zekken Alter,2020-10-19 18:22:12,"Seriously, what a great game Genshin Impact is. The game design is great, characters are likable and have unique playstyle, the soundtrack is superb, the world is vast and beautiful, the story of the game is intriguing and the gacha system is sadistic as always. I loving eveything about this game, I'm pouring hundreds or thousands of hours and money in this game...",Positive,367,63
Francis Bacchi,2020-10-25 15:07:17,"This game... It just blows my mind how this is a mobile game, like damn this is magnificent! The graphics are outstanding, the voice over is amazing, and the gameplay is unbelievable. I called BS when a friend showed me this game and told me it was free. It blew my mind. So now that I have been playing for a bit I want to buy and play this game on console for damn sure! 5/5 stars you guys really deserve it and more. This game is just outstanding! Thank you for this amazing game!",Positive,483,95

The only problem is the loading, it takes long but then again there are more pros to this game.",Positive,307,58
Tan Ying Ying,2020-11-11 06:53:54,"Loving the game so far üòç just that the gacha rates are too low üò≠ Game takes very long to load, please auto start the game after logged in so can skip another step ""click to enter""",Positive,179,37
Dhale Barasi,2020-10-20 08:44:46,"I LOVE the gameplay. The graphics are the BEST I've ever seen in a mobile game and the story is well thought out and amazing! I truly, really, absolutely love the game. However, if I could change one thing about the game, it would be to make the game a little less pay to win and to make it a lot less grind-y. It would really help if you could make the level to move on to the story lower so you dont have to grind 6 levels to move onto the main story and side story every single time.",Positive,486,100
Charles parre√±as,2020-10-21 18:28:12,"It deserves the hype. Its a great game that would keep you playing long hours for days and weeks. I'm already at AR37 and I still play 6+hrs a day just roaming around. Although some changes that would be great would be like faster resin replenish/higher resin cap, more enemy varieties and alternate wardrobe for characters other than glider designs and more NPCs roaming the wild as well as random occurences/events to make it feel alive. I look forward to how the game improves in the future.",Positive,494,87
S≈çn Goku,2020-10-18 23:03:53,Awesome üòä Console level graphics on mobile devices . I just wish they keep up with the story of the traveler and his/her sibling with a fantastic endgame.Its a really nice F2P game where we get primogems for quests which gives us a chance to get the desired characters from wish and this a one of the best aspect of this game .Thoug at max settings & 60 fps it drains the battery a hell lot but the overall experience is very nice.,Positive,431,83

BigDaddy NauWa,2020-10-26 19:57:15,"Spectacular game with good graphics and good story quests along with other quests. This is a game whwre you have to grind from the very beginning.

Lost Bear,2020-10-25 02:49:54,"Loving it! The graphics are amazing, the story plot is engaging. All in game missions and other activities are not repetitive. The voice actors! Characters are just so well rounded. Finally, you can do whatever u want while playing tbh: explore, cook, mine, hunt, help people by doing random quests, get to know the city and teyvat in general, read books, farm etc. Last thing! The animation is just so smooth and pretty... I cannot say enough about genshin... it's everything I wanted in a game.",Positive,496,86

U wanna fly, explore kill mobs, (hunt for meat XD) do what u want. Massive open world that will extend even further in upcoming updates.

MissTamaraAshley,2020-10-22 09:12:27,"Been addicted to this game. Was worried it would lag on mobile but it runs fabulously and smooth. Controls on the game are great. The gacha system is good, you have in game currency you can stack so you dont have to spend a single cent on this game if you dont want too. Most of the lower reviews complain about nothing to do, but there is tons in this game. Even after the ""quests run out"" there a ton of chests and enemies in the world to fight. You will always have something to do in this game.",Positive,498,99
OOGandamu,2020-10-24 11:45:26,"Genshin Impact has a breath taking world with cool and unique characters as all gacha games have but the game play and everything else in this game is not one to miss! It definitely has specific things to work on for future content such as end game mechanics, overall the game will have about 30-50 hours of content with enjoyable story and treasures that you will find to occupy yourself. Also known as breath of the husbandos/waifus!",Positive,435,77

Ishan Gupta,2020-10-19 13:10:11,"I'm lazy to write reviews but this game is just PERFECT. It has everything I was looking for in a game, free roam, good main and side stories, fun and bug free fantasy world... It's a delight to play, you can see how much has gone into this game (even common people have been voiced) and best of all, it's NOT pay to win, which actually makes me want to support this game. It kinda reminds me of ALO from sword art online (?). Thankyou developers fire making the dream game I've been looking for :)",Positive,498,96
Anime World,2020-10-23 23:43:49,"Best RPG game for android with awesome graphics. I'm really enjoying this game. I had played many RPGs but I gave up after playing 2 or 3 days . But this game amazes me . There are lots of things to do. You can see many wonderful places here. When I have free time I play this game . The story, characters, places, background music everything is wonderful. In many other games we need to spend money for playing nicely.

FastTapper,2020-10-18 12:55:16,"It's a great game, but unfortunately low rates to get the characters you want. The story and gameplay is AMAZING if you don't care about characters. I have 2 5 stars, and I'm very happy, but there's always the lingering feeling that I probably won't get another 5 star for several months because that's just how the games work. The open world is amazing, and the story is still expanding. However, the resin system needs to be reworked. It's too limiting and makes playing the game boring at AR30.",Positive,497,89
Rick Astley,2020-10-24 15:21:58,"The best F2P game. But the problem is the resin system. If the company ditch the system and enable us to fight the boss as many as possible like Monster Hunter, it would be the best game ever. Also the drop rate and pity system was quite stingy. Better increase the 5 star drop rates and reduce the pity to less number of pulls",Positive,327,64

Benjamin Lee Khen Heng,2020-10-12 19:13:03,"Great graphics, gameplay, combat and overall very fun to play. Fairly Free-To-Play friendly as its more dependent on knowledge and skills to play well. Biggest issue right now is the lack of resin which is required to farm for upgrade materials and equipment. Considering how fun it is to play the game, it seems very counterintuitive to lock players from playing more of it. Easy fixes to this problem include increasing the resin regen rate/free daily full resin refreshes/reduce resin costs.",Positive,494,81

Pratyush Kumar,2020-10-18 00:58:15,"This is the absolute best game I have ever played. The Genshin Impact team has done a remarkable job with this game. I still remember getting goosebumps when I started playing the game. The gameplay and cutscenes are so smooth that they actually feel connected, unlike many other games.

It controls nice and the UI is done amazingly, though I do tend to have an issue with accidentally pressing and holding the attack button when trying to move the camera, but it doesn't ruin the experience. The only feature I would recommend adding is offline play, as that would make the game more accessible to people. Though that is my opinion.",Positive,459,84
Vincent Milazzo,2020-10-21 13:54:14,"Incredible! The quality and production value of this game exceeds every other mobile game I played. There's just so much to do with so many fun features and worlds to explore. Definitely worth the install, you get a full triple A game experience free to play. (Granted, there's a gacha system for unlocking new characters and summoning currency is a little stingy to come by after the intial tutorial, but even then, it's worth the install.)",Positive,441,76
Keelan O'neill,2020-10-19 10:06:43,The gameplay graphics and controls are amazing especially for a ported game and this is a gatcha game (it has loot boxes) but that shouldnt turn you off of this game the story is amazing and the only real thing realy simal to breath of the wild is the exploration in other words this game is amazing and you should definitely try it out.,Positive,337,64
Lennie Moore,2020-10-20 00:35:37,"First off - It plays better on PC. That being said I love how you can continue playing on your mobile when you are not in front of a computer or console. This game is amazing. I put in 30 hrs before even considering paying money. You can play without paying a dime but I chose to, it's supporting the developers. On the flip side you get some gacha purchases which is lame but for what I spent on... by the time I invested into the game I didn't mind",Positive,450,90

InsaneInsect,2020-10-20 10:30:52,"This is probably one of, if not, the best mobile game available as of right now. Graphics are beautiful, combat is fun and the story is engaging. The only thing that is holding the game back is the gacha system, although you don't need to worry about it until you're at least 10+ hours into the game. And the game is free, so I think that excuses the gacha system.",Positive,364,70
AnselSy,2020-10-23 12:40:46,I really love this game. this game is so addicting so much. but the only problem is the resin system! please remove the resin system so that we can play more time to this. I promise to give a 5 star rate if you remove or upgrade the resin system because it svcks. I need to wait few hours to farm again. I think thats the problem of all players that are higher adventure rank. I hope you can change it. Thanks!,Positive,410,82
American Home,2020-10-24 19:15:55,"For a game that is free, its better than any other paid game I have played.

Just give this game a chance! It is so good.",Positive,303,65
Revv Anandadika,2020-10-26 10:16:23,"This is a masterpiece, no ads crossplatform open world anime voice actor and that's for free, i'd feel pissed to them who rate 1-3 cuz only gacha system, they're actually good cuz has guarantee system and that's enough, i dont have 5 stars chara but i'm enjoying this game at all, and exploring the world is the main point on this game so that's understandable why we're only have few resins",Positive,391,71
Aurora,2020-11-08 20:15:10,The game takes a lot of storage but I think it's fun. A lot of the gameplay resembles legend of zelda breathe of the wild,Positive,121,25
John,2020-10-24 09:25:37,"Fantastic graphics! Amazing setting and lore. Easy to play. The only issue I have with the game is the items you gather during the game. It's not clear initially what they are all for and sometimes it just seems like I'm collecting stuff because I can. But honestly, it doesn't take away from the game at all. There are plenty of guides online that explain a lot of what's going on. It is a fun, easy to play adventure to game. Very cool and I don't usually go in for these type of games.",Positive,488,94
Rachit Soni,2020-10-21 17:21:39,"Well now i see what the hype was really about, its the best adventure game out there highly recommended, nothing less expected from mihoyo, the graphics is awesome and the quests are all amazing, i can play this for all day without getting board. And this game feels a lot like realistic the way it is designed usually rpg games are not designed like that, but this was beyond awesome",Positive,384,70
Unknown,2020-10-18 13:53:24,"The game is absolutely amazing. To the character, art style, design, story, the world and many more. This game is amazing on mobile. The is the only rpg game that I actually enjoy. I love the beach of the wild like design as well as nier automata inspired design. The gameplay is one of the best ever in any game, the coop is good. The characters are amazing to the design, story, and their voices. Amazing game overall",Positive,419,78
melody smch,2020-11-11 08:36:49,"The update take 5gb, i play genshin alot in mobile platform so basically now i have 11gb game in my pocket. Next version 1.2 do we need to download another 5gb? If yes than probably need new phone only for genshin alone. Not make sense but yea the game is good :')",Positive,264,52
Arkent Nathanael,2020-10-23 11:08:14,"Absolutely phemomenal. This game is amazing. Give it a few days, and you'll love the characters, the story, the world. Don't have to mention about the OSTs, they are great. Though this game needs a lot of grinding, that's just one way of relaxing. You are not required to rush the game. Just play it slow and wait for more story updates.",Positive,337,62
Jeffrey Tay,2020-10-22 00:56:06,"Enjoyed the fact it is a cross platform game. Characters are adorable, voice acting for different languages are just so cute. I think character customisation like the appearance of the attires, hair styles and weapons should be an option so that players have a sense of personal in-game identity specially for multiplayer",Positive,321,52
Rozaq Pratama,2020-10-21 22:48:13,"i suggested to you developers, please improve the character movement, more realistic parkour, and while stepping in the tree trunk it looks slippery, so please improve all of the movement, make it a realistic parkour/just like stepping a rock just like in real life, or parkour like AC game in console, thats all, and fix the connections to all server thanks",Positive,358,61
Muhd Firdaus,2020-11-03 10:47:09,Perfect game aside from it being built on top of gambling system. I do wish I don't have weird audio and mouth sync issues.,Positive,123,24
brookes sullivan,2020-10-19 07:00:45,"Absolutely fantastic. This is BY FAR the best mobile game, and raises the bar to a brand new level. Unbelievable graphics, deep story line, innovative and fresh real-time combat system, and great audio... the only hang up i have is that you can't adjust the control locations. Nonetheless, fantastic work developers, and thank you!!!",Positive,333,54

Maxine Hope,2020-11-06 13:10:43,Been waiting for this kind of game! Although the missions can be a bit too hard at times but everything is good! Recommended game,Positive,129,24
Ceasca Sotelo,2020-11-06 17:32:14,I love it so much but when I was about to be lvl 26 in adventure rank it stopped. It was full the exp bar was full but I got stuck in lvl 25 for no reason,Positive,154,37

Bruno H√´na,2020-11-08 06:44:28,"Im sceptical on playing game like this , but this game is very WOW .... No money needed to go further in the game. Just taken mobile game to the Next LVL ..",Positive,156,33
Sopanha Leng,2020-11-01 18:58:35,I love this game. When I downloaded it I feel like it out of the elements but when I played it deeper I was wrong and I so glad that I play this wonderful game. And I hope everyone on this planet got to play this game.,Positive,218,47
Ram Superable,2020-11-11 06:44:35,First gacha game I ever played but best open world I ever witnessed. Keeps you hooked for days. And still incomplete so I look forward to more future content.,Positive,158,29

Esther Chan,2020-11-11 08:00:20,Really fun. The controls are easy enough for me to learn to fight the bosses and i really love the stories.,Positive,107,21
Roshin Emmanuel. Sebastian,2020-11-11 13:31:19,It like a VR experience as I'm there. I love this game Just that it is too heavy for mobile.,Positive,92,20
Gamer-4- Ever06,2020-11-14 09:14:10,This is the best game i've ever played.I've been playing for a while now and the enemy is getting stronger and harder to defeat as your level is getting higher.,Positive,160,30
Devanand Ps,2020-11-15 15:38:46,"One of the best games I ever played , The freedom of moving in the map is what makes it better and the graphics are really good",Positive,127,27
Nulifin,2020-10-25 13:46:05,"One of the best f2p gacha game, lots of content like spiral abyss, getting new characters, exploring the maps and daily and weekly tasks to do. To those people that are complaining about how hard spiral abyss is or how hard it is to get resources, that's just how the game is, if it is that easy to reach the end state of this game, nobody would play this game long term, think about it before complaining.",Positive,406,77
Kevin Vergason,2020-10-23 01:50:13,"A fun, breath of the wild style of game. Its cross compatability with PC and console make it easy to pick up and continue anytime, and the RMT market is not in your face and, refreshingly, not required to enjoy the game. Although the mobile controls have room for improvement.",Positive,276,50
Cutter Vernon,2020-10-19 22:06:10,"This game is phenomenal, one downside is that you will need to plug your phone into power while playing on the highest graphic settings bc the game is very power hungry. The game can be played completely free to play without spending a dime on the Gotcha. Very nice experience.",Positive,277,50
Yap Jie Huan,2020-10-18 23:04:18,"This is like the best addiction app I ever played. The story mode is very creative and fascinating. Not just the story mode but also the characters itself, they are all very unique and have their own personality and their power can combine with anything you are comfortable with.",Positive,279,49
Michael Chisholm,2020-10-18 18:44:31,"Controller support would be awesome! This game is so good. Sound can get glitchy if I play too long without logging out. Combat mechanics are about as good as you can get with a touch screen. I would pay for this game. I like playing the archer. Imagine how cool it would be if you had controller support and VR resolution. Don't have to be 3d, just double the screen so you can see it with VR goggles. Could then use head tilt controls to aim your shots. That is my wishlist for this game.",Positive,490,95
Sharn Fraser,2020-10-18 05:04:59,"This is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute best open world rpg game on mobile! Nothing else even comes close! As far as im concerned all other games are just fighting for 2nd place at this point. Genshin impact literally has every single thing that I could want in a game, not to mention that its a pc and console level A+ Quality experience on your mobile device! I cant stop recommending this to any and everyone I come across! Please don't stop doing what your doing!",Positive,476,89
jubaer uddin,2020-10-26 07:38:07,"This game is truly amazing. This RPG game has quite literally changed mobile gaming. Yes the Resin system is broken and needs fixing but the whole point of the Resin system is too force players to take their time with the game. If you're not looking to speed run to endgame, id recommend this game to you",Positive,304,57
Nada Elbadry /ŸÜÿØÿß ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿØÿ±Ÿä,2020-10-22 05:35:27,"It's Amazing I really love it but I really hope when you choose the girl character the game treats you like a girl not a boy make it fair please. And I really hope there's a dating in this game, please I don't want any gay sides in this perfect game don't ruined it for me if the main character is boy make them choose to date girls and if they choose the girl character make them date boys please DO NOT MAKE A GAY SIDES!!!",Positive,424,86
Rya Patton,2020-10-18 16:26:03,"My two biggest issues are I keep randomly attacking because of where the attack buttons are while I'm trying to navigate, and how I have to load every single time when I even blink over to another screen navigated from the game (like this review or website notes). Those are my only issues. I love this game.",Positive,308,57
Muhammad Zidan Fianji,2020-10-30 23:39:26,"The gameplay is amazing, but why the ping in game is unstable? It's always around 200ms or more. I'm in asia and choose the asia server even",Positive,140,27
Jayden ryce,2020-10-27 01:13:00,"Love it, but want it on Xbox. My friends and lots of the people of the people of the Xbox players would love this amazing game to play. This game is amazing with its open world, building teams and a really good story..... But I am not aquainted to the mobile controls and cant get a Playstation and dont own a PC either. I feel that putting this awsome game on all consoles including the ""Switch"" would really make this game even more amazing.",Positive,443,84
ali remili,2020-10-19 03:54:10,Personally i think it's a hole different game adding a good story in the game we can advance in the game as we wish: you can climb the buildings for a better view not only but you can also fly and enjoy the game. The time I'm writing this it's my first day so I didnt have to go through a lot of things but as a I am in rank 12 I really like it. Hope the developers continue the hard work and they should know that there is a lot of people who encourage them,Positive,458,97
Bryce Kelly,2020-10-20 02:21:01,This game brings a new generation of gacha games with including an open world RPG experience. I have played many gacha games over the last several years but this one is the best so far. As long as they keep updating and adding new content this game will be easily my favorite game of the year.,Positive,293,56

MAL-MAL CHENMAR,2020-10-18 13:11:14,"I love tthe game it's simple and it has such great graphics but I would like to make a request of getting easier intertwine and acquaint fate, it's really hard to get it and pls fix bugs like mine when I defeat a ley line quest I didn't get anything even adventure rank point also make it easier to get adventure ranks, pls make a redeem code feature and also in co-op mode pls make it that we could trade / give others items or characters",Positive,439,86
Aodxxc,2020-10-20 10:23:41,"The Game is Fantastic, From the Visuals, Gameplay, Characters and more! I really am glad that I've downloaded this. But I want to Suggest that transferring data in PS4 should be possible, I don't want to create another account and start again. I've come so far to the game already! But other than that, The game is good.",Positive,320,58
Tyler Rain,2020-11-14 23:16:26,My Klee does more DMG to herself then the enemy does from my experience that's kinda messed up that you made it even possible in the first place when using her I love the game but that part annoys me,Positive,199,40

Keanu Caguioa,2020-10-20 11:49:46,Can't wait for the Switch port! PS4 version runs smooth as well! This game is stunning and I'm suprised at how free to play is actually free to play! We need more games as stunning as this one!!! My only wish is that there was more means of travel because it does feel a bit slow running around to find each teleportation spot. Other than that it is amazing all around!,Positive,369,71
AutobotQuincy,2020-10-19 16:26:33,"An insanely good game, I had low expectations when i saw the ads but this is one of the best if not the best game on mobile, the graphics are stunning, story is beautiful, voice acting is great, gameplay is satisfying and amazing, this game is massive, has big potential, cross platform and is getting more updates and it's unbelievable how it's free.",Positive,351,63

Lemonade,2020-10-29 10:30:23,"I love the open world exploration. Music and character design are awesome! There's also an option whether you want to co-op or not. They also give primogem (paid currency) for free. Though gacha rate sucks, I'm here to dig the story so it's not much of a problem.",Positive,263,48
Sy Fx,2020-10-30 05:33:11,"They really have outdone themselves with this masterpiece. They've done anything they can to make this game as perfect as possible, combining open-world elements that many PC players love with anime-style to stay true to their audiences. They even prioritize single-player experience for F2P players so that they don't have to pay to compete with other players or anything. I think they deserves at least 9.5/10 compared to other mobile games, if only the gacha drop rate could be improved a little..",Positive,500,82

Benedict Esquillo Jt,2020-11-15 10:48:20,It was definitely one of the best games for free. I hope I can play this on my switch since my phone is a bit laggy but overall I enjoy playing Genshin Impact. Looking forward fot a switch version,Positive,196,39
K. Willow,2020-11-14 09:56:24,This is a quality gacha game. It follows the concept of gacha but its world looks so good that you sometimes forget that it's a gacha.,Positive,134,26
Jesse Townsend,2020-10-22 05:04:49,"So I made it to Mondstat and so far I really like this game. Great story, really good graphics, nice touchscreen controls. I do have one complaint and a suggestion. Complaint: even on low graphics the game has a bit of lag and causes my phone (Samsung Galaxy S9) to heat up and the battery to die quickly. Suggestion: Controller compatibility. Some of us just prefer a controller to the touchscreen. Above all however I do greatly recommend giving this game a try. Its worth it.",Positive,478,86
Baum,2020-10-18 18:48:53,"Great game, fluid controls, runs reasonably well on my phone. The gacha system hasn't really affected me so far, but this is definitely no game for completionists. It's a bit annoying, that you constantly need internet connection and I wish you could pet the dogs you sometimes find in towns.",Positive,292,50
Christopher Ekundayo,2020-10-25 22:51:09,"This game is stunning! Beautiful graphics and wonderfully animated cutescenes. The Voice Acting is top notch, and the world and it's lore is immersive. Feels a bit like breath of the wild, and its inspiration is evident in its world map. However, the game still feels unique.",Positive,275,47
Jason King-Snaza,2020-10-26 01:08:18,I was expecting a pretty decent game from Mihoyo seeing as how Honkai impact was one of the best mobile games you can find. Cant say I was expecting this. It's not just a Zelda clone. This is a true game not a stereotypical mobile gacha game. Read some article talking about it being the first true AAA gacha game. There's a reason its on PS4 and PC as well and there's a reason its being reviewed by websites like IGN and the like that usually don't ever review mobile games.,Positive,476,91
Omar Y,2020-10-24 14:48:50,"Honestly, so far this game is comparable with some AAA PC titles I've played. I'm not sure how bad the grind will get in the future or if there's a paywall but up until now I've been playing for hours and I can't stop great game, great art style, overall pretty good.",Positive,267,52
Abisha Zaki Ar-Rafi,2020-10-19 17:52:18,"Great game with great graphics and a non-linear storyline. Not very microtransaction heavy, multiplayer with friends, or just play alone and enjoy the world. Very demanding, but the extra processing power is worth it. Great voice acting and animations on the characters. Well thought out elemental mechanics on the combat. Very fun and is very mesmerising if you're able to run it at higher settings at 60 fps. Highly recommended. It's free, it's great, it's beautiful. Quick heads up on the 5GB data",Positive,500,83
Cherie Hong,2020-10-27 01:48:22,"I'm an amateur to mobile games, but this has been thoroughly enjoyable so far. The graphics are great, the controls are simple, and the storyline seems interesting. It does drain my device's battery quite quickly, but I suppose that's to be expected of a game with this much data.",Positive,280,49
tangent char.,2020-10-18 00:20:54,"I really love the game, but the thing is that the towns seem really baron sometimes. If possible, may the characters we encounter in the story actually exist as NPCs? Like Amber just walking around the wilderness, Lisa in the library, or Xiangling cooking at their restaurant. It would give a more livelier feel to it, especially Mondstadt. Other than that, if an option of petting the dogs becomes available, this would be the best mobile game I have played so far.",Positive,466,82
Liamy _69,2020-10-23 07:19:34,"The game is 5 stars no doubt, though that's a biased opinion because I love gacha games, for the sole reason they take so damn long. The only issue is, this isn't a game for mobile. It's clunky, laggy and overall doesn't feel good at all. If you haven't already, get this game on console and PC for a better experience.",Positive,319,61
Cordi Hamilton,2020-10-28 10:55:39,"This game is so much fun!! I love that it's english dubbed as well most games like this aren't I also really like that you can't auto run to quests, it gets boring just tapping on a quest and you automatically start running, it's nice that I have to find my way there.",Positive,268,53
Angle Wearwolf,2020-10-29 10:01:30,I love this game however I do not like the insinuation of pimon being emergency food I'd rather be her friend then eat her I know it's a meme going around and when I see it I ignore it because I don't agree with it so if time on goes away I'm going to be pissed off to no end,Positive,275,60
Nico Gaming,2020-11-11 07:44:34,"Awesome Map, Great Graphics, Easy Controls!!! You guys got it all, This is a really fun and a great gaming experience",Positive,117,21
Alec H,2020-10-24 07:50:01,Easily one of the best Mobile games you can play .. Not one of those terrible menu based games that must have took a month to make. They put some serious effort into this one. Large open world to explore and 3D action combat. Actually like a console game. Look forward to play on phone and PS4.,Positive,294,57
Rebecca W.,2020-10-20 19:56:47,"The only mobile game I've ever stuck with. This feels like playing a PlayStation game on my phone, the range of freedom in the game is unbelievable! It's impossible to get bored with this game because of the charas, storyline, quests, etc. Sometimes there are small glitches, like enemies moving to attack then respawning repeating movements, or the screen fading out and moving to the next scene while a character is still talking, and one time I got stuck while fighting the dragon boss.",Positive,489,84
Piotr Ptak,2020-10-21 03:45:40,"I love this game. It's not pushy with MTXs and offers you hours of game play and progress. The story is quite interesting and simple. In my opinion if they don't change the way of the monetization, it will stay the best mobile game because for me it's the best one I have played so far.",Positive,286,56
AGG Mira,2020-10-26 13:13:20,"So far quite fun to play, beautiful story and environment with awesome soundtrack for casual players. But controls on phone needs a bit of improvement. But overall it's a fun game to play. Rushing the game too fast can prove to be boring. Take your time playing.",Positive,262,47
Xiee Moon,2020-10-29 08:28:59,"Changed my review, so I finally decide to download it even after it requires nearly 6gb of space. Anywho, totally worth it. Theres always something to do, very unique game. Open world, good story line, not necessarily a pay to win unless you really really want the other characters.",Positive,282,49
RataCademic,2020-11-12 13:18:17,Really good and having lots of fun but have I problem it is P2P concept based game . How hard you try you stuck in certain level were you need p2p character,Positive,156,32
Utkarsh Kumar,2020-09-29 16:11:18,"Voice acting could be better, a little more focus on the main plot could've been great too but this game is about as close to Zelda BOTW as you can get on a phone. It's fantastic. Controls feel great, weapon designs are great, the art is amazing, the mechanics are awesome. The sound design and OSTs are great too. There's little to not like in the game.",Positive,354,67
Bokko The Bunny,2020-10-20 03:17:41,"In depth combat, and not an auto farmer. This is a fully 3d experience, and an actual game with quite impressive graphics even on low settings. Honestly I'm impressed how well it runs and his much fun it is just to fight things. There is gacha, but I haven't delved much into that or the cash shop yet. Overall it's great, just wish I could cross save with PS4, so I'm stuck playing in my phone.",Positive,395,76
Yuuto Suzuki,2020-10-24 00:51:19,"I like the interactive style of this game, almost all of the games nowadays focus on level and equipment so you can rarely see anyone exploring the whole map not on the guise of a quest but purely discovering. I'm hoping for a costume function either leatherwork, weaving or any that could also work through buying (real money) but it could also be created through primogems, crafting. Overall, I'm seeing a big potential for intearctive gameplay in this game.",Positive,460,79
Lalaine Denaguit,2020-10-24 19:16:46,"I don't usually like to play this kinds of games that requires a lot of space in my device, quest and all that. But it changed when this game was recommended by my boyfriend and I couldn't even stop playing this game. It's so refreshing and yep, first impression last. Keep it up MiHoYo.",Positive,287,54
Emmanuel Wong,2020-11-03 11:05:28,"After the update this game has been prtty good sisnce then, i want to make some suggestions. Can you make the stormterror's lair have new bosses and spawn in monster dens, thank you",Positive,181,33
Navi Singh,2020-11-05 23:03:52,I happen to have a very good experience and feeling while playing this game. It's the game I think I was waiting for ages. I really really want to thank the team and appreciate them for this best work. I feel very relaxed while playing the game üôÇ,Positive,246,48
Nishan Limbu,2020-10-28 23:35:38,"I love these games everything . In my opinions all game lovers must try these game these game can provide almost all the expectation that the game player imagined.

Andressa Corr√™a,2020-10-31 06:44:00,"I love the gameplay, it's challenging enough to keep you interested, but not enough you ragequit often. You can gather enough gems for one pull a day by playing one hour of exploration or domains, which is nice. It lags a bit but does not detract from the fun.",Positive,260,49
Koko Tomoe,2020-11-09 00:24:06,I honestly love everything about this game. I don't play games too often but I really enjoy this one! The graphics are so pretty!,Positive,129,24
Hsu Lai Nandar,2020-11-09 16:07:30,I really like the open world experience.Another thing is the music.Most games I play don't have music this good.But I wish I can get a 5* character/weapon in the upcoming updates T^T.,Positive,183,32
Justene Pelaez,2020-11-09 07:36:56,"I can't believe I would play such kind of game in mobile. I know this is not a big deal for everyone, but one of things that I notice in this game is how the animations of characters conversation unlike other games out there just making repetitive gestures. Overall its really a good game and maybe the best rpg in mobile.",Positive,322,61
Slain Gain,2020-11-11 06:58:04,"Game is awesome only problem is that archery is kinda difficult because of the controls but it still doable, this game is worth installing 100%",Positive,143,25

Carole Wigno,2020-11-11 06:58:58,So much fun and so much to do. It feels more like I'm playing an RPG like Breath of the Wild than a phone game.,Positive,111,25
Heather Hutchcroft,2020-11-11 10:27:48,The only thing I wish was in the game is a trading system both between players and the game. Of course the trade have to hold the same value.,Positive,141,29
Thugresa,2020-11-11 15:43:43,"Honestly im surprised i can even play such a beautiful game on a phone, the open world is detailed and filled with things to do it's not just some random grass fields with nothing in it",Positive,185,36
Morphetz Erts,2020-11-11 08:12:31,"As this is my first gacha game, I must say it got me addicted first time i ever played it.This is for people who wanna try a gacha game for the first time.Very fun and good F2p gacha game.",Positive,188,39
zion Flavell,2020-11-11 08:33:29,This game is incredibley massive especially for it being on my phone!! It does feel like you need a pretty powerful phone to play this game though,Positive,146,27
Adrian Siniawski,2020-11-12 02:44:31,At last game with story line and free open world. I'm fan of Final Fantasy and this is game like I haven't see for ages on android 5 stars.,Positive,139,29

Magista Windcharmer,2020-11-11 20:20:26,"Everyday is a unique adventure, graphics are so good and i like how everything lives up to the element based type. For example there's a quest for wiping out some dirty things on floor, you need a hydro type character to do so. Walking on water through cryo types is pretty wicked. I love this game.",Positive,299,56
Camryn Elizabeth Hall,2020-10-19 06:35:25,I am in love with this game. Surprised me by surpassing my expectations by Far! Definitely was worth the wait. Don't let the fact it shares many similarities with BOTW keep you from trying it out. I love both games. And they are both great in various and different ways.,Positive,270,50
Tripl3Z,2020-09-29 14:08:22,I can feel the effort of the Maker's of this game . I feel like watch watch an anime at the same time am playing it .the voice acting is perfect it automatically pulls my ear when the NPC is talking while am listening im also reading the subtitles . And the storyline is great. Sorry if my English is bad . But this is what I feel about the game thank you so much for me I think this is the game that I been waiting for .,Positive,421,89
Jonathan Santos,2020-10-20 14:30:23,This game has a lot going for it. It is open world and nearly all of it is intractable. As you go you accumulate characters with different elemental abilities. Each character can interact to accomplish various elemental tasks. The graphics and game play are amazing for an app and are comparable to the PS4 version. Love it so far!,Positive,331,59
Austin Ngo,2020-10-03 04:44:55,"First impressions of the game are amazing. It's not your mmorpg, but it's a rpg with the gacha system incorporated into it. The graphics are amazing, and makes you feel like playing a $40 game. As a gacha game, It executes it pretty well giving enough rewards to start out, and leaving you in the dust as you progress. Glad they might optimise the way to get duplicates easier. Overall, a game most people would enjoy.",Positive,418,76
Matthew Sosa,2020-10-23 02:34:39,"This game is truly amazing. It is completely worthy of all the hype built around it. The gamplay, characters, story, and all the rest of the game, all are incredibly well made. I can't wait for even more content to be released. I would also love to have some 5 star characters, at least 2, but the summon rates have shown me that may take a while and lots of summons. The banner summons should help though, especially for the promotion characters. This is a game is a great choice for anyone.",Positive,492,92
Blizz_Robin 24,2020-09-28 20:18:19,"i love this game so much. i pre registered right away when i saw the trailers for it. i first thought it was gonna be a breath of the wild copy but after i played it, i saw that it was doing its own thing. which was great. i love the characters and i like how you can unlock many characters that is voice acted. everything is awesome and i love how you give us free rewards. i just wish there was a way for a power saving option so my battery doesn't die quickly and sometimes the cutscene lag.",Positive,494,100
Jack Massey,2020-10-19 17:01:41,"In love with this game! I just got this game a few days ago and I already play it all the time, I love everything it has to offer! The characters, story, graphics, it's all so good! The only thing that's a bit iffy is that your skill is partially luck based, and draw rates are so low for 5-Stars, it's really a game of chance... I've gotten 2 5-Stars, while two friends that okay much more don't have any",Positive,405,80
Joseph Demun,2020-10-11 00:57:10,This game is amazing free to play! Huge world and tons of content not to mention the challenges! You may breeze through the first part of the open world but if you don't manage weapons and gear you will find yourself lacking so it keeps you on your toes when it comes to the management of your team. Each character has unique skills and play styles. The story line is great and they actually put effort into the voices so it makes you want to listen to what they say. Great job on this game title. A must try game!,Positive,514,100
Kenneth Gerald,2020-10-28 14:52:49,"controller support would be cool since the pc version already has controller support, it would be nice to add it in mobile too for easier grasp of controls.",Positive,156,28
Nor Izzuddin Talib,2020-10-21 02:16:32,"Ngl the best rpg to date! Easy to understand the basics and leaving it up to players to explore the land and freedom of choices! The world building and the gameplay is so awesome i don't care if i have to spend money on gacha. Trust me, if you like open world rpgs, you wont find anything better!",Positive,296,58
Astro Boy,2020-10-08 19:54:49,"Exceptional game indeed! The story, quests, graphics, voices, characters everything is amazing! But I have a complaint about the pc version. Many people including me are not able to play the pc version. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a very good pc. My laptop is a 3rd Gen Intel i5 core with 4gb ram. But the game stops at the warning about siezures and stuff. Please is there anyway I can play on pc version.",Positive,419,77
Subham Parida,2020-11-10 04:56:09,I was curious why our main character don't have voice in the game but the game is far excellent than any game i was ever played in mobile.,Positive,138,28
Abhi Gupta,2020-10-27 23:18:06,Really amazing game. I am mind blowned by level of detail in this game. But as a beginner it get little bit confusing as there are lot of currency items and items to level up. Perhaps a simple guide would have better. Still is really great game like Witcher 3 on android. Hats off to the team.,Positive,293,57
Nathan Burton,2020-10-21 02:13:43,"As far as mobile games go, this is by far one of the best RPG games going. Not only that, it is cross-platform with PS4 and PC. The story line is brilliant, I usually skip over all the dialogue in games but this had me gripped, with the voice acting. Only one thing I don't really like is the camera, I like to be zoomed all the way out but more often than not it zooms itself back in, and has a mind of its own, panning this way and that way while I'm trying to mine or attack an enemy.",Positive,487,101
Nathan Major,2020-10-20 06:01:24,"A couple of hours in and it's been a nice casual, and fun run so far. UI handles pretty well on mobile. Once you get to AR30, you realize there is not much to do, all the chests are generic items and you get extremely handicapped by the resin mechanic. The most irritating thing being the weekly objective of using 1.6k resin and you can only regen at most 1.2k. Kinda ruins the gameplay, wish you could grind more With that said, it's a fun, beautiful game that everyone can enjoy at their own pace.",Positive,500,95
FAoS Wendigo,2020-10-26 03:09:53,"The game is fantastic! Easily one of the best games of the decade and probably the best mobile ever! The graphics and story are amazing for anything mobile, and the world and the things to do make the game worth playing endlessly! Easily one of my favorite games ill ever play!",Positive,277,51
R Ja,2020-10-01 23:54:34,"This game is beyond amazing, it shows that they create this project with love, a ton of detail in the open world, you could explore literally everywhere. And honestly you don't even need 5star character, the initial team do just fine, because the main point of this game is about exploring the map. Really a relaxing and immersive game to play. For people who complained about the lag, your phones or pc specs needs to meet the standards because this is after all a fully interactive open world game.",Positive,500,89
Htut Min,2020-11-11 13:31:43,I can't open this game. It is stopping (after entering the gate) and showing only white and uid at the corner. Please give me solution or fix this issue.,Positive,153,29

Broly The Legendary Super Saiyan,2020-10-23 08:29:36,"THIS IS THE BEST GAME OF 2020!! (This is my opinion) the graphics on mobile are almost equal to the graphics on PS4 and PC. The game plays is free to play with many opportunities to obtain the in game currency. Although not everything has come out yet, it still has the capability to surprise the economy!",Positive,305,57
Prohan Z,2020-10-20 10:42:42,Hi great game! But can you add more features? Like dungeons that everyday it will be available because the domains only can be open once and can ya add some mounts? It will be great if you add some horses! And make a farm route for primogems please! Or just make an pirmogems farm i would love to see it! Or make the lock chest that been used reappear again like the chest in hilichurl camp it is lock pls make it reappear,Positive,422,83
Joseph Adrian Padriga,2020-09-30 14:32:15,"One of the best action role-playing action video games in a long time. The gameplay is so great that it reminds you Breath of the Wild with an anime storyline that is still in going. Also as a gatcha game, it doesn't reallly feel like it unless you aren't contended enough already. The great amount of rewards that this game is offering is surprising as well. With a decent amount of grinding, you will get your materials in no time.",Positive,433,80
verdorg,2020-09-29 15:38:22,"Too Good to be true, i like the gameplay, open world, but if you can invite some friend to play in roam mode in open world it would be perfect. Well the music are great, the combat, elemental reactions is easy to learn. The graphics is top notch. Quest and Looting is fun, it makes the game enjoyable. Paimon really cute, well she is. Keep up the goodwork.",Positive,356,68
Jubenson Barretto,2020-09-28 17:32:40,"This game is easily one of the best on Android. You can just appreciate the effort that has been put in all aspects of the game. The overall game design and gameplay is top-notch. The world feels vast and fun to get lost in, it really feels like a grand adventure. The story is great and combat is smooth. Switching between characters and getting creative with combos is hella fun.",Positive,381,70
Moayad Albluwe,2020-10-04 07:45:00,"Is this the perfect game of 2020?? Well, nope to be honest, but it's definitely my favorite so far on android, the game gives you a rich experience, something you'd expect on a proper gaming platform, but for free, and portable on your phone. The game has stunning graphics, awesome soundtrack, great audio effects, nice physics, and one awesome story! Although the game is free, and you'd expect microtransactions and a paywall, I haven't encountered any yet, wish is nice and kinda unbelievable.",Positive,497,83
TacoDude08,2020-10-06 15:18:54,"One of the best games I've ever played There's pretty much ALOT to do, and the element system may seem complicated, but you'll get the hang of it once you find out which elements react with each other, and dish out some serious damage to the enemies Also, any character is viable, so you don't need to spend money at all, unless you're a collector, lol I'm definitely looking forward to future updates, and more to come",Positive,419,77
Xue Hua,2020-11-13 10:44:43,One of the best mobile games. I have been longing for this kind of game for a lonnnng time. It deserves 5*.,Positive,107,22
Violet,2020-10-19 04:10:28,"I got addicted very quickly this game is so much fun to play at your own pace, and with you not NEEDING to spend money, it's so much more fun A bit of a grind, and rates for summons could be better since getting multiple copies are encouraged, would be nice too up rates in the future",Positive,284,57
Lahiri Espinosa,2020-10-19 20:52:32,"This is an excepcional game! It doesn't have the best story, nor the most complex combat system, but it is beautiful and entertaining as hell. Considering it's also free and not pay-to-win (tho it has some gacha mechanics), it really deserves the 5 stars in my opinion.",Positive,269,47
SquiggZE,2020-11-11 19:50:59,The graphics in this game are beautiful similar to breath of the wild but it will burn your phone battery... other then that 1000% recommend trying the game out,Positive,160,29
Asabou kirha,2020-10-17 22:29:43,The game is great and excellent. But there's a problem with the eyes of characters we use. Most of their eyes looks dead. Especially the mc and Barbara. Maybe brightening their eyes could help. Since it is kind of disturbing looking at the dead eyes when casting their ultimate abilities,Positive,287,50
Chimmy,2020-11-01 16:53:52,The Graphics and Story are absolutely stunningly beautiful and well made i can see why you need 6 GB of space for this but it's all worth it! A nice adaption or relative to the classic Breath of the wild:Zelda and a very nice combination of Adventure and Solo RPG there's also Multiplayer in it too! There's so much to explore with unique characters! The features of each characters are unique! It's very nice i highly recommend it. Hopefully more games will be added to android like this one!,Positive,493,89
Sean Maayo,2020-10-16 19:01:59,The game is good but better with a phone that meets the recommended specification requirements so you can play the game with out fps drops. You can choose whether you will be a free to play player or spend some real money to it. It is a vast open world so you can enjoy exploring new places and waypoints. Its a very good game and highly recommended.,Positive,350,67
Tzen Lee,2020-10-05 03:37:42,"Totally phenomenal I'm mind blown by everything this game has offered and I haven't even played it yet on my phone.

Korey Nolan,2020-10-05 06:32:44,"This game is amazing I would tell anyone to try it out,if you liked Zelda botw. Worth it early on 100%, but after rank 20, or sooner the game dumps on you so many gaps/ LVL gates between everything fun that you're left with nothing to do but open boxes. You can get a full game feeling experience for free till rank 25, but I would say don't except (for now) it will continue to please ya. The summon rates are so low and the prices are so high it's warped. Reward vs. time/money is not there at all.",Positive,500,99

I know there's a gatcha system that people might be frustrated about, but most of the time your playing the game there's so much to do the gatcha system doesn't get on your nerves. I've played this game for over a week and a half and I have never playeda better gatcha or rpg game so give It a shot!",Positive,495,100
Ahmad Otto,2020-10-03 04:40:03,"I'm impressed this game can run semi-smoothly on my phone and it doesn't drain my battery as rapidly as I anticipated. The developers really did a great job calculating dimensions of the in-game structures too. Everything in Monstadt is well-aligned. So far I'm enjoying the character designs, especially Paimon's loli aesthetic, the great graphics and storyline. Although, I wish the game had a server in my region; North Africa, Egypt.",Positive,437,70
Fal√© Do,2020-10-09 13:10:38,I love the storyline and graphics! The controls is a bit tricky to use at first but I got a hang of it. I also installed the game on my laptop but it freezes after 5 sec of logging into the game (even everything at low specs)...plz fix that so that it could be played on a laptop with minimal requirements. Otherwise everything is going smoothly on mobile üòä,Positive,357,69
Jumpy 0002,2020-10-31 22:05:42,"This game is fantastic! There are some bugs, like sometimes the audio messes up and I have to restart, and some things were not translated from Chinese, but thats to be expected since the game just launched. So far, the game has been so much fun and im looking forward to support its development in the future!",Positive,310,57
Michelle William,2020-11-11 06:58:43,"Great graphic, Great storyline, Great character art, Great gameplay ! Can you add a summon count ? I loss count of how many 10 pulls did i do haha..",Positive,148,29
Mac Fierce Son,2020-10-22 05:52:11,"Best F2P game I've played, and can legit be played fully free. Spending $$ is hard not to do, as it's always fun to increase your chances at more rolls for characters and/or items. I like to support good developers as well, and Mihoyo sure has put a lot of time and love into this game!",Positive,286,56
yhan gavrielle tarriela,2020-11-08 13:41:06,Nice with the story and BOTW experience and wish that anemo and pyro can increase gliding height with wind or fire linke botw and wish that i can see my FPS/frames per sec and pls add more things like other weapon and editable character,Positive,236,44
Daniel Deleon,2020-09-29 14:50:22,I can not believe that this is a mobile game. This feels like a console game. This is so beautifully made. I love the fight style. I love the story. Omg I am so hype to play this game. Most open world games doesn't feel right and the graphics isn't there. But this game omg its perfect. I could go on and on. This team did an excellent job with this game.,Positive,355,72
Miden Arithmos,2020-10-03 12:53:13,"Don't bother with the 1 star reviews, They're probably complaining about how Their phones can't handle it. With that out of the way, it's one of the best game I've played in a while. Hooked Me up with its open world gameplay, beautiful visuals and the Characters. played this for hours and doesn't get bored, there is a gacha system but since it doesn't matter that much at the moment You can play it fully without spending any cash. Definitely should give this a try.",Positive,468,85
Liam Takeda,2020-09-28 22:36:27,"I accidentally pre-registered for this game not knowing what it is and then I thought whatever I'll try it out and I believe it was fate because I love it and I could definitely say that so far I think it could be better than some expensive games I buy for PC! The graphics are mind-blowing, the fully voice acted story is wonderful, the creators really did an amazing job with this game! Ithink it's so good that I will have to recommend to my friends to get it which I never do with any other game!",Positive,500,97
A J,2020-11-13 10:01:27,"My absolute favorite game ever. But there is one thing I would suggest, can they make it so that there is customisable control settings.",Positive,136,24
Lonely Pretzel,2020-10-05 04:07:25,"I highly recommend this game on PC, and maybe some newer mobile devices. I have a Pixel 3 though and there's lots hitching (fps drops), like barely playable if I am in combat. I get a temperature warning after about 20-30 minutes of play as well. I mainly use the mobile version of this game to do something real quick while I'm out, such as commissions, check expeditions, get daily rewards, etc.",Positive,397,72
Arga Adolf Lumunon,2020-11-11 06:57:39,"When the game is more optimized for Snapdragon 835, I might just give 5 stars. Though for the story and gameplay it's amazing",Positive,125,23
Raditya Mulyawan,2020-09-30 13:43:01,"The game runs very smooth, i never experienced such a game like this in mobile. Beautiful world, beautiful story, and its safe to say that the gameplay also very exiciting. The only thing i want to see in this game, and its essentials for an open world mmo fan is to meet some real player while exploring the world. I hope u can consider this in the upcoming updates, so the world feels more alive. But thanks for making this game with NO AUTOPLAY, keep up the great works.",Positive,473,89
Amirreza Hashemi,2020-10-06 14:26:11,"Amazing game, but with bad microtransactions. You will pay almost a full price of a AAA game for rolls. The rolls needs to be much cheaper otherwise I will just buy COD black ops. 10$-20 is fair for a 10 roll. World is huge and everything works nicely. Story is meh, but they are giving so much value for free. The price should not be that close to a full price game, that's a no-brainer for people to save up for the game and skip on rolls",Positive,440,87
Jeysson Escalona Castillo,2020-10-19 12:08:55,Wow ive literally played the game for a total of 30 minutes and absolutely love it already. The graphics itself is good enough to give this at least a 5 star and then you have the fact that you are literally spiderman in the sense that you can climb anything it just makes it that more fun,Positive,289,57
Zchan Bttraz,2020-10-06 14:05:13,"The graphics are great, and its hard to level up and fight, making it more fun! You also get an adorable companion, which I quite appreciate. Though I'd like if there was a skip button for the videos where they describe stuff, but if its necessary, then don't add the button. Either way, this game is awesome!",Positive,309,57
Ewok N. Roll,2020-10-03 22:33:24,"This game is spectacular, I can't believe that I'm playing a game of this level on my phone. It's more like a console game, seriously, you have to try it. The open world format is wonderful, the English voice acting is great, and the animated cut scenes blend seamlessly into gameplay. Just be sure you have good WiFi, or an amazing high speed data plan. The only thing missing is gamepad support. There's an option to submit feedback in game, if we all suggest it, they might add gamepad support",Positive,496,90
Ernie,2020-11-11 10:06:05,Love it. Its easy to understand. I hope the developer make it easy to earn primogems to wish more heroes..,Positive,106,20

maykol villalobos,2020-10-20 11:52:43,"This is an excellent game, it runs very smooth, graphics are excellent and the voices of the characters is something that I really appreciate in a mobile game like this, I like the fact that you can play with friends in different consoles as well, very good job, fantastic game.",Positive,278,50
isai garcia,2020-09-29 14:35:57,"This game is amazing! From the graphics, to storyline, character design, and the voice acting that doesn't sound cringe at all. It feels like Zelda and probably has the same graphics as Zelda üòÖ but with touch Gatcha summoning like most game nowadays. But for this game, I'll give a pass since honestly, with how much work they put into it, they deserve every dollar they can get. Great game so far and look forward to what more they offer to the game and to their customers to keep them playing.",Positive,495,91
Servius Lyfield,2020-09-29 18:13:20,"Revolutionary for a mobile game! I hope this will be the standard of mobile games from now (not a money grabber). The freedom in this game is so massive. What I love the most is the music and the character voices. The graphics is so beautiful and very BOTW-like, blends well to the BGM. The very flexible combat system this game is a gem, it give player freedom to experiment between elements and possible combinations. This is the immersion for a mobile game I was looking for.",Positive,478,87
Robert D. Bivins IV,2020-10-02 16:58:23,"It does take a LOT from BoTW's systems... And textures... Among many other things. However it seems to have its own spirit and brings a couple of interesting ideas to the table. I ESPECIALLY enjoy the interactions between different types of magic in the game. The gameplay is nearly as addicting as BoTW, which is saying something for a f2p phone game. As a whole i would give it 4 stars, but because id like to see more fleshed out games like this instead of the current moble trend, Im giving 5.",Positive,497,92
Acel Pajarin,2020-11-11 06:06:07,miHoYo have proved that a game playable on mobile devices can be incredibly detailed and complex; unlike many that came before Genshin Impact.,Positive,142,23
Jovany Maldonado,2020-10-19 00:19:07,"I really enjoy this game, I hope developers make us spend money only for clothes and not for power. I really hope this game is only for skilled players and not pay to win. I also hope you can give us the bikkini buy options for our girls. I really hope not to get disappointed by this magnificent game.",Positive,302,59
Jon Athan,2020-10-19 21:28:51,"After installing this game, my phone's battery runs out very fast. I also feel like im very sleepy ever since. It feels like i bought a AAA game for my phone w/o spending, totally free to play. I guess im too much addicted to this game? Dont play this during work, it consumes your whole lunch break like its just a minute ago",Positive,326,63
andy ang,2020-11-01 11:36:09,"This is so damn good, no more to say. Only gacha part is kinda sucks, the rate is very low. 3 account and countless draw but still got 0 diluc or jean....",Positive,154,32
Orbit is a Miracle for InSomnia,2020-10-08 17:54:10,The only game of this genre that I enjoy playing for over 2 days. The story is fun to follow and read through and it's crazy how I actually looking forward for the next missions considering I never really enjoyed playing this type of game before. The only sad part is my smartphone can't handle higher graphics settings than the lowest and I can only play this game for less than 3 hours on full charge. Imagine wanting to play more on an off day but couldn't.,Positive,460,87
Jaydin Brand,2020-11-01 16:30:52,"This game is fun, easy and really cool u can play as different people and the controls are good it a cool anime mmorpg game if u like mmo games I think you should like this one",Positive,176,37

Jai Salamero,2020-10-28 10:13:28,"This game is fun, open world, best fighting mechanic, high graphics and good storyline but there is something missing please make the control buttons layout changable because sometimes I miss click sprint and dying and make adventure xp a little high to level up fast, and add more quest thats all, waiting for good future update.",Positive,330,56
Samuel Woodruff,2020-10-07 12:18:49,I have this on both mobil and PC.. the game is amazing. I am stilled baffled as to how this is free. I have played for well over 20 hours now. The micro transactions are not needed at all. Progression is great with out them and with a little work and time and luck you can get the same stuff in game with out spending money. The element mixing is an very unique twist on a the commen concept. The art is breath taking! I am running on a galaxy s20 ultra and have no issues with sound or graphics,Positive,495,100
Ezekiel Morrow,2020-09-29 08:53:42,"This is the kind of mobile game I've been looking for! Inspired open world, fun characters, beautiful design, interesting story... It's wonderful! I'm so excited to play along as it grows, it's already worth a play all on its own letalone what the cheerful staff have in store for us. I especially appreciate that I can hop between PC and mobile. That's a wonderful feature.",Positive,374,65
Kenny Ng,2020-10-24 23:20:54,"If you ignore the gacha system, this is hands down the best game anyone can find on mobile. I was dumbstrucked when I found out it was a chinese based company mihoyo that developed this. Thumbs up and I do recommend anyone to try this. Play it on Pc if you can. It's a beautiful game.",Positive,284,56
Conan McDonald,2020-09-28 15:39:26,"Only played the game for about an hour so far and I'm hooked. The graphics are outstanding for a mobile game. Definitely on par with some console rpgs. Noticed that one of the glider costumes is available for ps4 players. Didn't realise it is available to play on ps4 as well. Definitely gonna look into that as I would love to play this game with controller support. Not sure if there is controller support on mobile version, if so, then I'd give this game 6-stars.",Positive,466,85
Danny Fantum,2020-10-02 10:01:29,"So far this game is amazing. A little stuttery on my Galaxy S9+, but I do have my settings on high, so I get it. Still though, cross-play on console and PC with a mobile game? And one with this kind of quality no less? Plus, it's a gacha game mixed with moba elements that sounds, plays, and even FEELS like Breath of the Wild. I am THOROUGHLY impressed so far. Haven't gotten any 5 stars yet, but I've only done a couple summons so far, so we'll see. Looking forward to the game's rapid growth.",Positive,495,96
king squash,2020-10-16 13:52:26,"This game is really great and I admit I am addicted. I don't have any complaints except One thing. I would like to change the chest system. If I open a chest the items will pop out but sometimes they go too far and if your on a mountain the item will fall all the way down making it annoying to have to go all the way down the mountain just for an item. And sometimes you don't even find it. It would be nice to have the items stay in one spot. Just keep doing your best, and have a great day! :D",Positive,496,104
Ghea R. Amelia,2020-09-30 21:08:10,"Everything about this game is absolutely awesome ! You can go anywhere, climb anything, every places are breathtaking, the story is great, the characters are amazing !!! Everything is great ! That's why the game has a big size and kinda heavy to run. But overall it's awesome, a PC level mobile game !",Positive,301,54
MISAEL G.P.,2020-10-07 08:20:00,"I'm playing with a low end device (4GB RAM Snapdragon 632) so I played with ultra low settings, still the game runs fluid and with close to no hiccups. Story is compelling, VA one of the best I have witnessed in a F2P and the pulls quite generous. No paywalls, auto play or ""you need to buy this character otherwise you can't proceed"". They made a game were you spend money because you want, not because you have to. Don't listen to the nintendrones, play it!",Positive,459,86
NDT 0117,2020-10-04 08:25:23,"Great game so far! I really like the Breath of the wild feel, yet it's very different from that. Though it does have pay to play elements.. you don't have to pay a single cent if you dont want to! You can get everything in game through grinding or adventuring. Amazing graphics, and I Love that you can crossplay between PC and Mobile!",Positive,335,63
Alex Sy,2020-10-02 07:20:09,"If you're into anime style action RPG games this game is for you. It's open world too which is rare on a mobile game. The storyline and characters are unique and add alot to the overall fun factor. Mihoyo have really outdone themselves. Haven't been able to put this game down since! Its great on the PS4 too! Although it's very unfortunate I can't play my saved game on my mobile on my PS4 and vice versa. Please developers, allow for cross platforming from mobile to PS4 too! Please!!",Positive,486,89
Thomas Ramirez,2020-10-03 14:50:34,"Great game with beautiful graphics, characters, and it is a really big open world game. If you grind fast enough you may find yourself with little to do, BUT the game just came out and they will be adding alot more content to come. I've had a great time and great game imo. Side note, if you have an older phone it may be a little laggy. Luckily this game has cross save from mobile to PC so you can play on both if needed.",Positive,423,85
SKyAce,2020-10-06 09:17:05,"The game is very fun, I love the graphics and the gameplay. I love what the game gives to me and experience that I'm getting. But my main account is on PS4. I just wanted to make a review here, so the developers can see it. Pleeaase make the players in PS4 choose what ever region or server they want to go in. I don't want playing with my friends with 250 ping on my game. Also making an another account is hard and my things that I earned will be gone. 5 stars, love the game. Waiting for updates.",Positive,499,100
Kasey Bandeaux,2020-10-06 08:01:10,"This game is wonderful. I love exploring the open world and finding new places and items. I think its great that not everything is completely spelled out for you, so the player has the chance of being able to discover new game play functions all the time. The only thing that makes me sad is that some of the cut scene animations tend to be a little glitchy when they play. Hopefully that will be something that can be fixed, because the animation is beautiful.",Positive,461,85
Erika Navaja,2020-10-21 10:01:41,So far I have enjoyed the fact that this is cross-platform. I originally installed this on iOS and was relieved by the fact I can log in from my created acct from iOS. Hope they improve the constellation system for their existing characters though. Not all can get the character from the gacha system.,Positive,301,54
Kailasanathan V,2020-09-28 16:50:19,"Just recently started playing this and absolutely loving this game! It's super epic, one of the best open world RPG experiences in mobile.The music is so relaxing and exhilarating at the same time.The world is designed in a beautiful way.Yes, you have to download 5.8Gb resources after you install, but the experience is totally worth it!If you have wifi go for it! And it's great that it doesn't push you to continuously play, you can come out of it anytime and log in later to cont. where you left.",Positive,500,89
LazyStray,2020-10-06 21:27:33,"A lot of fun! basically a free breath of the wild with catch a thrown. Perfectly able to play most content without spending a dime. I do wish costs for pulls were a little lower, then I might have even spent a little money myself just at a chance to pull some characters, even though it's not nessicary. Phone controls work but it's better on pc imo as your phone can be a bit slow. Same with cut scenes, they won't load well on the phone but are fine on PC.",Positive,458,91

Shi Obu,2020-10-08 10:06:01,"I can't believe this game is free to play, everything from the UI to the story is stunning! I'm impressed that we are able to have such a large openworld on a mobile-devive. Mmm the characters too, they have soo much personality and development. The devs defenitely put a lot of work into this, props to them :). This is an unbelievably immersive game, it almost gives me a SAO S1 vibe (the first few episodes). If full-dive vr ever comes out, this should be the first game to be ported on it.",Positive,493,93
Henri Lay,2020-10-01 21:59:23,"I want to find a good rpg without advertising and a lot of popup mesage without an horrible ui. I find it. It is. Super game, fluide and easy to play. It also had beautiful graphics and musics. I can switch the void in japanese and keep the game in french. A must have for the fan of jrpg like. The world is so huge also and you don't need to spend a lot of money to enjoy the game.",Positive,382,80
Ryan Magee,2020-10-06 12:32:04,"Very fun gameplay with a creative combat system. Swapping characters mid fight feels effortless and fun. I didn't hesitate to spend a few bucks on rolls to support the developers, even though the drop system seems sparse, usually only netting weapons and i have yet to see a 5 star character. The lineup is good for a new game and its nice to not be overwhelmed by the sheer number of trash units.",Positive,397,73
hanawabby,2020-10-10 00:55:01,"You got to love this game. It has a beautiful graphic, amazing and heartfelt soundtracks. As of the moment, the wishing system (unlocking highly-ranked characters) doesn't hinder with the story progression, and I'm glad it is that way. I enjoy the game, and I think I'll stick around with it for a long time.",Positive,308,54
Kenny Morales,2020-09-28 23:23:57,"This is the most best game I have played for a while. This can rival games that are even on Console or PC. I have no problems with starting the game, nor do I find myself with huge lag spikes. The performance is great and the animations are fluent. The problems I do have are just personal. Like I am not one to like the Gacha system of getting characters by luck. Another thing is I would love for this game to become Controller compatible. But overall Amazing work!",Positive,467,89
Matt Hart,2020-09-28 10:30:35,"I can see this becoming an addictive game to play I've only been playing for a couple of hours and I absolutely love it I didn't want to come off, the graphics are amazing and I definitely can see the resemblance in style to the legend of Zelda breath of the wild, storyline, characters, gameplay in general is all top notch well done to the developers you all get a massive thumbs up from me.",Positive,393,75

Curtis A,2020-10-03 23:39:48,"Highly anticipated game that's finally arrived! I beta tested the PS4 version and was sold immediately. Playing the mobile version for the 1st time, it's definitely designed well for touch screen phones. Graphically great, sounds & voices are on point, and gameplay is fluid responsive. Only issue so far is the freezing especially during cinematics. It's not game breaking, but it needs more optimizing for smart phones. 1st day release, so issues will arise. Once that's fixed it'll be perfect!",Positive,496,80
Natsuki Sato,2020-11-10 02:38:00,"I really like it's almost everything I like about it. It's perfect game for people who love Open fantasy worlds you should play this game.

Mr Suamalainen,2020-10-25 18:44:02,It's awesome. It has an awesome open world. I love how the stamina works and the glider is awesome too.

Something to fix is like while minimizing you shouldn't be able to disconnect , it's annoying when you're looking up a guide or something for a couple minutes or even seconds and you disconnect . Also being able to adjust your controls would be helpful , the configuration now is okay but editing them would be nice .",Positive,487,89
Matt Jones,2020-10-22 21:20:50,"Love the game but will uninstall due to not being able to crossplay with PS4, i know PSN has it's restrictions unfortunately and i would just love to be able to play the game more when I'm not at home which in all fairness great job on the Devs for making a game that I'd still love to play when I'm out.",Positive,304,62
Ankush Surnam,2020-10-10 22:20:39,"Gameplay, visual, sounds, action, all is awesome. My only issues are controller support and optimisation on Android. I use note 9 and it starts boiling after 1 hour at minimum settings, so it's difficult to play on the go, as the battery drains way too fast and the connectivity is slow even with great internet speed both on pc and android(4G). Now Idk if it's only on my phone/pc. But the game is great non the less, keep it up.",Positive,430,80
blavena,2020-10-09 04:02:48,"Great game, surprisingly smooth on my g7, runs perfectly, way more than I expected. Having the option to play on the go is amazing, still, touch screen sucks and always will, so I recommend the pc version whenever possible. The game is awesome, a very nostalgic adventure style with traces of gatcha and stuff (and sadly the unavoidable p2w). Way too much potential, I hope they reach it soon enough",Positive,399,70
Lisa Marie,2020-10-25 03:18:19,"This game is great I dont understand why people would not play it it's on ps4, PC and mobile I think this game would have very good ratings but some people do not like it its very fun to play and this deserves 5 stars because this game almost catches up to fortnite and its available on every platform this is only available for 3 platforms the was how this almost catches up to a ps4 game is amazing and if your reading this post and you have a ps4 or PC you should try it to on mobile.",Positive,487,99
Joshua Smith,2020-10-04 01:42:10,"I wasn't sure what I would be getting into when downloading this game. I've been in search for a good rpg and have played many mobile games. A lot of them have false advertising and turn out to be a disappointment. That being said, this one so far is my absolute favorite. I can get sucked in for hours and for a mobile game, feel as though I have a console experience. I am really impressed with the open world feeling for a mobile game. And the graphics are something to mention too! Try it.",Positive,493,95
Leo Grefaldo,2020-10-09 18:17:02,"It is the best game on mobile phone i've played so far. I rarely get interested to a mobile game as i find games in it boring due to lack of console games feel, but genshin impact is just different. I love the graphics, the gameplay, the game story, everything about it! The developer sure did an amazing job! I commend the genius minds behind this game.",Positive,354,67
gewnilly nightcore,2020-11-11 11:36:44,"I've been playing this for a while and it a great game the story is good the graphics is the best and all I can say is, this is an enjoying game",Positive,144,32
Captain Renevene,2020-09-28 20:09:02,"I gave a five star because it really got me hooked. Despite the big world, my phone could handle surprisingly. Oh the audio, it was just beautiful. The story as well! I wanted to finish prologue first before starting my work, but it got me real hooked. Ah, but for some reason, cutscenes are very buggy. Images don't move and transition, the audio becomes gritty. Pretty much the only problem I'm having. I'm sure you will fix it soon, so here's an early 5 star.",Positive,462,85
fajar krisnaprahadi,2020-11-15 00:02:23,"For this update, some story at children's last mission has corrupt. Please, fix for these problem... For enjoyable experience for gaming",Positive,136,21
Taylor,2020-10-02 08:03:21,"I play this on PC but I have this on my phone as well, I'm genuinely impressed with this game! Fully cross platform and that's something kinda insane. Combat is fun, mixing characters for combo skills is fun. Music is really good in this game and surprisingly so is the voice acting. My only complaint is in co op, if you join your friend you can't loot any chests. You only get loot in co op dungeons if you have resin. Basically you can help your friend doing quests but you get nothing for it",Positive,495,95
Aeron Hale,2020-10-02 10:30:14,One of the best games I've played on mobile without a doubt. The gameplay is seeingly simple yet has many aspects to it that make it interesting & more complex under the surface while the world and character art is excellent. I've experienced no bugs or crashes to speak of yet and have found it to be a very enjoyable experience to play.,Positive,338,63
Andhika PS,2020-11-11 06:30:05,"Great graphics, great story, great open world for smartphone, great bgm, loves all the character especially Paimon the emergency food.",Positive,134,20
Kharis Prasyanda,2020-09-30 15:19:32,"Truly one of a kind, console quality mobile game, one could say that its a masterpiece (compared to other mobile games). Controls are nice, gameplay's fantastic, and the crossplay between device is really awesome. The only downside is that the game's kinda heavy on my phone, even though my chipset is snapdragon 845 (I play on medium settings). All in all, highly recommended",Positive,376,63
Jacob Aulich,2020-10-15 11:56:06,This is a really amazing game. There are a few things that I think would make it a better experience. That includes the moon system being either tweaked so that we are able to do more domains daily or getting rid of it completely. I think chest should respawn at least once a month or every other week. I've grabbed all the chests and it makes me not really want to continue to walk around the world. As of right now just doing the daily commissions is what there is to do and it can be repetitive.,Positive,498,97
Neo,2020-11-11 23:49:37,"I've had an overall great gameplay on the pc, except for mobile having issues with render graphics which practically made it unable to play",Positive,139,24
RGHRouesvm,2020-10-11 20:17:37,"I just love how the stories in the game just so unique and interesting. The NPC even have their own stories. I love to collect the books in the game, finding them in some random places or NPC just make it a whole new quest for me. I also like the actions of flying/gliding thru the skies and jumping roof to roof, or just climbing mountain and houses in the game. And the sceneries is breathtaking. It's a free world to explores and play",Positive,437,84
Hiranmoy Duarah,2020-09-29 06:09:44,"This game is one to keep. Everything in this game is high production quality. The best part about this game is probably the fact that it has no autoplay (like seriously it makes the entire experience booring). Instead it has trails that lead u to ur quest, isnt that fantastic? Game has some bugs tho, like freezing on cutscenes and minor frame drops. Nevertheless its top class and definitely a must try for RPG and anime enthusiasts.",Positive,435,77
Yakoby,2020-10-05 09:04:00,I really can't believe this game is free. The graphics are beyond what I thought could be possible for a mobile game (mostly likely because I don't play that many mobile games). I love the story because I also see how much time they put into making it. There are books you can find that explain the world around you which I love reading. The controls are easy to understand and easy to use once you're in a flow of a battle. Overall Score - 10/10 open world adventure,Positive,467,89
Christopher Saltzsieder,2020-10-14 02:58:18,"I never leave reviews on games but this is one of the most gorgeous, high quality games I've not only played on mobile but in general. The combat controls are refined and smooth, the crafting is extensive, the material gathering comes naturally, the open world is massive, the story is fantastic, the elemental combinations during combat is a fresh twist to combat in other games, the characters are extremely interesting and even the questing is fun and has good storytelling. 10/10 great game.",Positive,495,83
Phan L∆∞∆°ng,2020-10-07 13:54:43,"I believe this is the new definition of excellent f2p model. No pay to win, no paywall, only grinding that is fun and meaningful in the gameplay. All characters have their strengths, so the gatcha model is purely for taste. Of course 5 star char is a bit more powerful than 4 star, but not much, and all chars can do end game with good builds. Graphic is superb, even better than most AA PC games, music is top notch. So many things to do and immerse. Highly recommended, and throw some money in ;)",Positive,498,95
Acearea Evora,2020-09-29 08:02:59,"I have played the game and i can say for a fact it is a great game. U can get what u'd expect from a well priced game for free, a decent story, great character models, etc. Most of the 1* reviews are stupid they haven't played the game. Servers were up early specifically for downloads. The game released today. U don't ""need"" to spend any money all general content is easily accessible and achievable if u've ever grinded in a game. And the game is large because it delivers in quality and quantity.",Positive,500,94
Inserte Nombre Original,2020-10-23 21:18:01,"Great game in almost every sense, even thiugh the gacha is one of the most abusive in any other gacha game available. Right now, it also lacks a good end game, so If you are interested on it, maybe it will be better to wait another 6 months or a year to download.",Positive,263,53
Mo Padilla,2020-10-05 12:24:06,"This is the best experience I have ever had on a phone. AAA TITLE, on the go. I absolutely love the heart and dedication you can see from the devs and actors. It has great voice work, Cut scenes are on point, and the gameplay is perfect. Above everything else, this plays better on my S20 ULTRA than my ps4 pro. Graphics are out of this world running pretty smooth with settings at max and at 60FPS. Keep up the great work team GENSHIN!!!!!!",Positive,441,84
AkaGe Enriquez,2020-10-05 01:15:22,"It's a very thrilling game. I wish you cam include the other members of the party to the fight. Or other people int he storyline to fight with you. Set all that aside. Graphics, storyline, battle effects, gameplay, ARE 10/10. THANKS for making the game. Bit laggy for old phones, I'm using s10+ and still using low quality. Maybe i need to upgrade phone ü§£ü§£",Positive,356,65
Javier Mendez,2020-10-14 23:51:11,"Decided to give this game a try after seeing multiple post about how good the game was, at the beginning I thought ""Just another anime-ish, cartoon-ish type of game."" And thought that after playing it for 2 days it would get boring...however that was not the case, the graphics are impressive, the story is really good and there is a lot to do. I don't consider it P2W because you can get primogem easily by completing achievments and exchanging for other usefull equipment/items. Great Game.",Positive,492,85
Bren Ca√±averal,2020-10-06 10:39:53,"great graphics... awesome storyline and there is so much thing you can do with the open world like climbing off the mountains, exploring your surroundings, cooking, finding hidden items, and many more! I really love it... I wish they could optimize the issue regarding lags and glitches with some devices... but overall it's an awesome game!",Positive,341,56
John C,2020-09-30 19:08:34,"Phenomenal gameplay, story, graphics, music... everything! It plays a bit like BOTW but is very much its own game, definitely not some Nintendo knock off. I have seen no pay to win aspects as of yet and the game is primarily PVE driven. There may be arena fights later, but after 25 hours of gameplay I have not encountered any pvp yet. There is co-op play as well, not just for dungeons, but roaming the massive world with up to 4 other people. Feels like a free full priced retail game!",Positive,488,91
Subby,2020-10-20 17:59:29,"Very fun free to play experience for 20 hours. In the end it is a gacha game with time-gates and low probability rolls so manage your expectations. Also. I can't enjoy this with mobile controls, I play on my PC mostly. But I'll get this on my phone just for gathering materials on my commute üòÇ",Positive,293,56
Emily Amos,2020-10-03 08:44:25,"Truthfully I checked out this game because of the uproar about it being a LOZ BOTW ripoff, but after playing it for about an hour it became quite obvious that it wasn't. I can see where Botw had given inspiration for parts, but besides thoughs the game is very much its own. My only wish is that I could play it using my bluetooth controller. If it does come out on the switch, I can definitely say that I will downloaded as soon as I find out.",Positive,444,87
NGIM ENG HWA,2020-10-24 05:55:27,"The music I'd calming and this is just... Great! These apps are so rare; Game developers these days only have half done games and put a bunch of ads into it! The developers of this game are really good, the graphics are amazing! This is a real game.",Positive,249,48
PyaeSone Aung,2020-09-29 02:04:40,"Very nice MMORPG with great graphics and art styles. Background music is relaxing and all character voices are cool. Even though the combat mechanic is a little awkward not the same as which I expected as to be like HK3rd, still attractive to play with beautiful scenarios and music. I would like the devs to add the ""Lock-on"" targeting system to make the character able to dodge better while engaging an enemy. Aside from that, everything looks really cool.",Positive,458,79
David Anderson,2020-10-07 23:20:45,If you liked Zelda: BotW you'll like this. While it's not a port it shares a lot of similarities but you don't have to worry about weapons breaking. Game play is smooth and there's constantly stuff to do / explore. There is no p2w model or content only accessible by purchase. It's cross platform as long as you link your account so you can play the same character wherever you log in from Only drawback is when playing on a phone it's very battery intensive so make sure you bring a charger,Positive,491,92
Jan Daenell Bancud,2020-10-07 12:26:52,"Genshin Impact is a massive open world rpg experience. Besides the overall charming and superb graphics, gameplay is well designed with hack and slash, arrow-shooting, magic-casting combat. The music is enchanting while the enviroments are spectacular, having a collosal open world to explore by climbing, gliding, swimming and teleporting is simply breathtaking. It is an industry-changing experience for mobile games. And the best part, it's free. 100/100 worth the wait, surprised the world.",Positive,494,73
Leo The Neo,2020-09-30 13:22:01,"Its a great game, but the lag is insane after a long play session, the controls could use a little work, the motion blur is amazing, the graphics remind me a lot of Zelda breath of the wild, and the stamina bar runs put a little to quickly. But other then that awesome game with meme potential, like with Timmy on the bridge, saying daddy isn't going back, like, Jesus Game Devs you had to go there XD",Positive,401,78
Mervin Villa del Rey,2020-11-11 09:46:38,"The game is great, it has the balance between f2p and p2w since you dont have to buy a gacha to leverage your play style, free characters that are given to me are enough and there secret missions all over the map that gives you 4 star equips or artfacts just by interacting on an NPC or taking up the side quest they give to me.",Positive,328,66
piko is shota,2020-09-28 19:59:52,"It's a really good game! Although it took me long to level up since i get side tracked most of the time, it's really good! It is a large game but the nice scenery and the amazing graphics make up for it. The game isnt all about gacha and it doesnt tell you to top up all the time. You can get nearly everythinv for free. The vast world is amazing to explore with friends. it's super fun, please do download it!",Positive,410,82
Slayer 123,2020-11-08 11:02:57,Absolutely love the game but the resin system is ruining it I think they should increase the resin cap and decrease the resin regeneration time to like 1 every 2 minutes,Positive,169,31
Mind_Less,2020-11-03 12:22:43,"It's a really good game I recommend not having it just on your phone tho, playing on the run is awesome but to fully immerse yourself you should play on console or pc",Positive,166,33

Matthew Lockett,2020-11-09 10:08:10,So far really good story and adventure. Plays different from a lot of semi similar games. Definitely worth a try!,Positive,113,20

Ethan Schutz,2020-11-11 12:11:02,"Its so pretty, gives BOTW vibes at first with its beauty but as you play you see that it is a very different game full of adventure",Positive,131,27

Kent Aninon,2020-11-11 07:15:22,it's a great game tbh. give us an experience to make clans and we can costumize the clothe of our characters. but all in all 10 stars for this game,Positive,147,30

Glen Nocturnville,2020-10-04 07:51:43,"I like this game, people said it keeps crashing but it depends on your phone specs it seems, cz it plays well in mine--even though it drains my battery fast XD The graphics and voices are amazing! It worth the hours of downloading! I don't really have any issues except the extremely low gacha rates XD Well, maybe devs just wanna get money for the efforts they put on the graphics and gameplay so I can't really complain. Anyway, it's an amazing game if you play if you play it on a correct specs.",Positive,498,94
Prince Romeo,2020-10-01 02:28:52,"This game is amazing! Only minor issues. You have to optimize the game more for sd 855 devices, including my redmi k20 pro. My gets really hot when I switch to 60 fps. For now 30 fps at highest settings is ideal for me. You have optimised the game for sd 845 devices. Poco f1 can run the game with no issues at constant 60 fps. I hope you fix the issue.",Positive,353,72
Justin E,2020-10-04 03:52:08,"So far for the first week of the game, everything is enjoyable. The graphics, story, open world, puzzles, and dungeons are all balanced. So far there is no need to have top tier units, you just need a unit of each element, which the game gives you. Its worth a download if you enjoyed Breath of The Wild. Just have to see what the future brings for endgame",Positive,356,68
Roman/Ludwig Weber,2020-10-17 21:02:57,"So smoove graphics may allow you to feel the deep of this game, so interesting mechanics, bosses, slimes), and ofcourse the way you play its just unbelievable. When I started to play, the game has intro playig backgrounds, the music is such of experience, when you listening the music its reminds me the anime ""DanMachi""( ""Is It Wrong, to Try Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?""). So I hope, that this game will have a future, for me this is a best. I wish good luck for creators, you've made a great thing!",Positive,500,93
Wendell Tyler,2020-10-02 17:01:42,"This is one of those that feels nothing like a mobile game. Its open world has little limitations. The progress can be a bit short-lived at first but the developers want to draw out the story more. Gameplay is great. Go off the beaten path and find monsters and hidden chests. Discover new companions to play as through the story or through the wish system. Progress in character, weapon, or artifact level and more. I'm still finding out more about the game but you can play as much as you want too.",Positive,500,92
Nyoman Saputra,2020-10-01 01:50:16,"This game is specifically created for die-hard open world MMO fans. Massive contents, beautiful maps and scenery, calming yet intense BGM, crystal clear voice over and easy to use UI, also in-depth explanations and tutorials for the game's features and for the battles. The panning of the camera might feel a little bit not responsive but you could just turn the auto-rotate off so it's not really a problem. Looking forward for more and definitely recommended.",Positive,461,76
Jms Lin,2020-09-29 00:21:40,"Never been a fan of phone gaming. There was always an issue, be like money wise or the mechanics of the game. Until i came across Genshin Impact. Everything works as it was advertised, for now I will leave everything at 5 stars. With an exception of the controls, just because there is no option for me to adjust the camera over the shoulders or a little bit higher to look down. Having the camera focus right into the character even when is zoomed out interfere the vision of what is ahead.",Positive,491,92
Patricio Carmont,2020-10-03 02:55:57,"The game is amazing, absolutely love it. This is my favorite game love that i'm able to play on pc and switch to mobile and continue where i left off. The combat is smooth, graphic is beautiful, always finding something to do. It just simple needs more weapon like dual swords, brass knockles etc, and co - op could be improve more but so far i love it",Positive,352,68
Brian Mendez,2020-10-20 14:11:47,"First of all, the game is splendid. The graphics aregood. Controls are good and it offers a huge map. But should add more characters to the game plus getting characters is not easy unless u pay money. Other than that the game is awesome.",Positive,237,44

The kids in the night,2020-10-09 21:55:48,"Absolutely the best mobile game on the market and the graphics are phenomenal and I have good internet and a good phone which is motorola and that is amazing and I cannot stress this enough, DOWNLOAD THIS GAME unless you don't have enough space as it is 6.2 gigabytes. 10/10 would recommend and if you like playing solo or with friends you can play with four people or by yourself. You get to choose you path in the game. I have it at max graphics but motion blur kills frames. So this 10/10.",Positive,492,93
Mr. Regular,2020-10-13 07:56:13,"RPG with a Gacha. Amazed by how well this plays on mobile and dosen't seem to drain the battery as much as I expected. Even runs well on my Note 8. I would suggest taking your time and enjoying this one. A lot of ppl complain about the stamina system...but that's litterally all Gachas lol. 60+ hours just hit rank 30 and theres still plenty to do. Only thing the mobile version is missing is controller support, it really needs that.",Positive,434,81
Nah YAdig,2020-10-03 07:41:20,"Truly an amazing game Beautiful atmosphere gameplay graphics characters and story. The way this game is laid out with no energy or limit restricting playtime letting you play and enjoy the game to its full potential. They made it so leveling up and upgrading character/weapons can be done with experience and time playing unlike other games where you end up having to pay to go further in the game. Genshin Impact is one of the best games I've ever played. Thank you developers, this Is a masterpeice",Positive,500,87
Acura TL GTLM,2020-10-09 23:00:33,"Beautiful game, honestly. I'm not one to play RPGs at all really, and this game is just a joy to play. The only real issue I have is that cutscenes lag and freeze A LOT. Like, I have to close out the game frequently and reload everything to get it to work 95% of the time. Other than that, (even though I barely just started), the game mechanics are easy to understand and figure out, and the camera is only slightly wonky, but overall pretty dang good! Only thing that needs a fix is cutscenes.",Positive,495,95
Jarred Caves,2020-10-06 19:21:00,"Went in with low expectations, as you see a lot of these games that fail to deliver. But I can honestly say an amazingly fun game. There is a few bugs in the cut scenes but fixed on one restart and glitches occasionally, but the game is worth playing anyway. Heavy on battery use so don't play without a charger near by. Also read a guide about currency's and wishes will help",Positive,376,72
kotkat,2020-10-13 06:25:33,"It's really outstanding-honestly. The reason I'm giving it a 3/5- well is because a tiny bit after it kept saying something in the app was causing it to be unresponsive, making the game close. I still don't know how to fix it. Great game overall! Edit: it seems like after I moved it out of my sd card, it was working properly. I don't know exactly why though. It works very well!",Positive,380,72
Vishwas Jha,2020-09-30 20:00:13,"This is my first time appreciating role playing ""mobile"" game. I mean its just awesome its music, graphics, controls, sound, smooth gameplay, Story everything. I even play this music while am asleep. but got some issues too. pls increase the stamina of the player with every level. and can't u use some voice overs for the dialogues of main character. And please improve climbing animation of the game and how can a player climb straight mountains its just not realistic. but all over its the best game i have ever played on mobile.",Positive,532,93
Vladimir G,2020-10-15 19:43:34,"The game is great and I love it. Good atmosphere and beautiful views. However, I'm having an issue when I'm inside the spiral abyss. It does not occurs everytime but when I use Venti's elemental burst, the game freezes my phone. It doesn't happen every elemental burst but it occurs everytime I'm inside the dungeon. I don't know how to fix it and it really does breaks the experience. Aside the issue in my experience, the game is still a 5 star for me. I just hope I could get some help with it.",Positive,497,94
Joseph Smith,2020-10-06 03:19:28,It is a beautiful game with a great story! The graphics are absolutely gorgeous the graphics remind me of Breath of the Wild. While the gameplay and story progression reminds me of Final Fantasy 15. The development of this game goes way beyond any mobile game I have ever played. I would have never believed that a mobile game's trailer was actually what the game was going to be and what the game would look like. But I would like to suggest that it would of been awesome to be able to change armor.,Positive,500,94
Kyle Yang,2020-09-29 02:02:04,"Knowing that its released, the gameplay is amazing! Nice graphics, easy controls, open world, etc. The only 2 downfalls that I've encountered playing is the cutscenes, it freezes up. The other is phone overheating, when it heats up, you lose progress. But other than those, the game is amazing great to play. Keep up the work! :D",Positive,329,57
Matt,2020-10-15 22:41:14,"Calling this one of the best free to play games I've played in a long time isn't fair, because honestly this is just the best game I've played recently, period. The microtransactions are there, but you don't need to pay a single dollar to play the entire game. It feels like a $60 triple A game with an optional gacha mechanic. You get plenty of free characters that are very powerful to the point where you don't need to pay for more unless you want to.",Positive,454,86
Gine,2020-10-04 22:12:01,I wish you didnt have to save up so much for a wish. Other then that it's great graphically. Story is cool the animations are impressive and it's a gorgeous open world. Also wish there was a more variety of enemies. Other then that five stars you are all amazing with mobile games great job! The future looks bright for this masterpiece!,Positive,337,62
Sa-Cn -D4v37,2020-10-09 11:20:40,"This is definitely THE Mobile game of the year, the graphics and the gameplay is amazing, its such a suprise how people can create this big of a game on a phone and still has a very smooth gameplay, even my phone that is not very good is performing very smoothly although it still heats up quite a bit. overall i love everything in this game, the aspect of open world, free camera everything is so well done, nice job mihoyo and hope you guys make a big update, i cant wait to see more content ‚ù§",Positive,495,97
Brandon Clark,2020-10-06 07:12:35,"Phenomenal game, gacha system is unintrusive, and not required to enjoy the game, the pacing is good, combat system feels refreshing once you get the hang of how the elements interact with each other and mid combat swapping. I spend most of my time playing the ps4 version and started on my phone too so I can co-op with my kids. The only complaints I have so far after my first week is the lack of controller support for the mobile version, and the inability to customize the key mapping on ps4.",Positive,496,92
Nalastaa,2020-09-29 04:45:50,"Best open-world game I've ever played on a phone! It's unbelievable that it works so well and there are barely any issues at all with the game that I could normally find with new games. The fact that it's free and that you can play with the same account on your phone on your PC and vice versa aswell, is mind blowing. You can tell that the developers have worked hard, and so they deserve a lot of cred!",Positive,404,79
ALPH,2020-10-07 00:42:06,"Beautiful gameplay. I keep hearing people call it a breath of the wild Rip off and though it's true that you can see similarities, just calling it a rip off is an insult to the game. I've only started playing today and it's been really good so far. The dialogue, characters, combat, story, artstyle. It's been amazing so far. Definitely worth a try even if you're not an anime person.",Positive,384,70
Jay - C,2020-10-13 03:14:06,"I feel like this game was just made for me. No auto battle, no overly flashy op skills, good voice acting (love paimon), and easy to follow story. One thing that blew my mind is how much detail they put into everything, and how they finally manage to nail the ""open world"" feel that I've been searching for in a mobile mmorpg. Honestly nothing but praise, and I'm proud to say in the future that I was here from the beginning.",Positive,426,81
TZETFEN,2020-10-11 12:34:09,"In this current situation, we need to wait 6 weeks by doing nothing because the lack of end game content/event for now. Patch 1.1 on 11 november isn't the best timing for PC players, it took too long, you'll lose many of PC players because of that, PC/PS4 players is different with mobile players. we have no battery, we can grind 24/7 anytime we want.",Positive,352,65
Sunchaser55,2020-10-16 08:44:49,"A revolutionary mobile game. Others I play now feel like trash in comparison. The story and gameplay are both fantastic. It may have a gacha element, but it isn't required. The characters the game gives you are great. Otherwise, the gacha rates and the rate at which resin recovers are my only complaints. Though to be fair, as bad as the gacha rates are, it does have a pity system that apparently carries over to future banners- which is better than most other gachas I've played tbh!",Positive,486,87
Arya Wardhana,2020-10-13 18:54:59,"Personally, i find this game interesting. It's a mixed gameplay from my previous favorite games. You get climbing, elemental sight, wind glider, dash sprint, aimed mode, and of course. Hunting and adventure. Something that i feel similar with some of my previous game that i would not expect. I know u included some famous VA for japanese for well. But that's good, you learn to understand player. Story you tell are really soothing. It makes me forget that this is MMORPG. Recommended game",Positive,490,83
srivatsan harish,2020-10-02 23:33:42,"It's a very good Open World RPG. Love it. The monetization is very non obtrusive. The combat system is epic. You can play all of the content without spending any money at all as far as I know. My only issue is that the drop rate for the 5 star loot very low, less than 1%. If that's increased it would be awesome. I have no other complaints. You should definitely give it a shot.",Positive,379,75
Leek San,2020-10-04 13:10:40,"If I were to describe it in one word. Phenomenal. Although the game heats up your phone after long periods of continuous gaming it is amazing to play on PC. People seem to complain about its graphics, lag and fps dropping but it is likely just their phone being unable to handle the load. I just want to point out that this game is cross platform across PC, PS4, ios and others, it is difficult to optimise. The game would always give you a goal which keeps you on the right track unlike BOTW.",Positive,493,94
DigiDawg2,2020-10-03 06:52:57,OMG I love this game. The music and visuals are beautiful and amazing. I hope they release an ost soon. the waifus are beautiful and cute and the the husbandos for the girls are cool and look cool as well. definite equality in quality of characters. all of the voice acting in all languages are well done. I can feel the effort and love poured into the game. my only gripe is figuring out the different money systems for the shop as I'm not sure what to buy to make the most of my money.,Positive,487,95
Stev S,2020-10-02 22:57:30,The game is one of the best games I have played and it's really good the only proplem is the character rates but I have heard that the developers are working on that and I would like to encourage you to do what your doing and not being like other games that doesn't care about the player and only cares about money keep up the good work and your game is gonna be one of the best games Thier is (don't make PvP a thing maybe a mode where you take on bosses with other player would be better ),Positive,491,100
Hayley Weber,2020-10-26 19:33:10,"A very fun and cute game!!! The story is really exciting. I have some troubles with the controls, but I am playing it on a small phone screen, and not on a tablet, so it's easier to be clumsy. All in all, I am really enjoying this game so far!!!",Positive,245,50
Sanjaya,2020-11-11 09:01:42,Its Perfect Game Ever but sadly the 1st update makes me waiting like nut for download again the game so its take A Long Time Please When there is other update just update it innplay store not whole download all of them in the beginning,Positive,235,45
brandon norin,2020-10-03 04:27:26,"Ima gonna be honest I don't wanna give this 5 stars. My reviews and words are meaningless without being read. But here it goes. It's straight up breath of the wild. But they left the ""mobile game"" aspect of buying characters and nothing really let's you make your character super different from anothers with unique choices. There's no real choices. Nice beauty open world and crafting that single handedly makes it better than any other mobile game by far.but how much you put into the world damn.",Positive,498,87
John Miguel Legaspi,2020-10-22 05:41:43,"A very great game, with the visual, gameplay and story all in one on a mobile game. It doesn't feel like a mobile game at all.

Hafiz Ashraf,2020-10-12 20:16:33,"This game is really good, and fulfill my expectation so far. But i have a suggestions to improve the player's gaming experience. Add equipment locking system. I think this feature is vital, because when you auto add materials for weapon, sometimes it also add high level 3 star equipment. I've experienced it once i upgrade my prototype grudge i accidentally added my refine +4 white tassel, what a waste. I could make a better use for that weapon rather than became exp food for other weapon. Thanks",Positive,500,87

GB. Cardo,2020-09-29 14:46:04,This is the witcher 3 of mobile games. They set the bar so high with this one. My only complaint is the control layout can't be customized on mobile. I dont like the buttons in the corner of the screen im used to having my thumb there for camera control. Like in call of duty mobile where the corners of the screen are reserved for your thumbs to use as analog sticks.,Positive,368,72
Thomas Williams,2020-10-01 15:36:35,"This game so far is amazingly fun! Its a more story esc breath of the wild mixed with a japanese rpg. I can see people might not like the combat being a little on the simple side, but thats just a side affect of it being made to be played on mobile. And lets be honest. The game is free but feels like a decent 30 to 60 dollar triple A game, and not one of those triple A games that are shameless cash grabs, i mean the old triple A games that meant something.",Positive,460,95
„Åã„ÅÑ„Å®,2020-09-28 20:57:59,"Best game in the History of Android games. This is the kind of game I've been looking for. I've played many kinds of RPG games and this is one of the best games ever.

Cameron Hemphill,2020-09-28 16:38:31,"This game is a masterpiece and the best seamless, open world action anime rpg on mobile. This should be the new standard for mobile gaming. You can tell the devs poured their heart and soul into this game from the amazing english dub, heart wrenching music, console level combat, story, graphics, world design, characters and gameplay. You can play at your own pace solo or co-op. Do yourself a favor: download this game, tell the next person you see, spread the word, and enjoy this AAA experience!",Positive,499,87

TheDoctor 21st,2020-09-29 01:31:32,"Its a wonderful game. I have spent hours already exploring and not even caring for the story. I love that I can gather and craft, which adds to more of the experience of this game. The gamely, the sole, and even how it runs, is amazing.

Sea Spirit,2020-10-01 13:53:36,"Its around 6 gb size but is totally worth it. If you can run it smooth, I definitely recommend. Relaxing game with beautiful open world, interesting systems and tons of exploration and secrets for you to uncover. It does include gacha to get stronger characters and weapons but so far even with the basic characters, it plays so smooth. Doesn't seem like MMORPG so far but more like online singleplayer RPG with CO-OP option to play with friends. TL;DR game is top notch and lots of fun.",Positive,487,87
Johan Ned Saravia,2020-10-02 12:58:10,"Honestly, if you want the definitive game to run around and go crazy exploring...its right here.

The download time is worth it 100% My only issue with this is that my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note9) seems to spark or click sometimes.

Ishika Samarasinghe,2020-10-18 04:39:40,"Honestly, best game I have ever played on mobile. Very detailed, graphics are insane and in-game purchases are not necessary. I would recommend this game to anyone that loves rpg and adventure. If u liked Zelda breath of the wild this is the game for you.",Positive,255,46
Le Thanh Nghi,2020-09-29 13:09:09,"The game is good. But when I transfer a game to SD card, only application (about 400MB) be transferred. The game data (more than 6GB) don't be transferred and still store at memory device. I had try delete data , transfer application to SD and download data again and but can't solve problem, the data still store at memory device. Hope this problem can be solve in next update. Thanks you for your reading.",Positive,407,74
Arctario,2020-10-11 00:07:20,"An open world anime styled adventure game with RPG Elements and also a Gacha system. I like how even though some characters use the same weapons as other characters does, they have their own unique way of doing so; from subtle variations of movement to their own style of attacking with said weapon. The graphics of the game are just stunning. Sadly, only a few minutes in and my phone is already throttling on its performance since I cranked the graphics to the maximum.",Positive,471,84
Andy Ramli,2020-11-14 00:37:11,A bit disappointed with this update. The story is way too short for a massive data consumption and I've finished every quests in just 1 day,Positive,139,26
K. Lesande Adnan,2020-09-30 13:33:25,"Simple Adventure RPG with beautiful graphics and easy to control. The game play and stories are not too complicated though quite challanging. With the vast open world and free roaming game play makes it even more intresting... The best parts is, its not pay to win game. Looking forward what next to come, more stories, more items, more characters etc. Keep up the great work üëç",Positive,377,66
Victor Molina,2020-10-28 07:24:14,"Genshin Impact really leaves an impact to mobile gaming. Its intuitive controls are easy to use. The gameplay, and flow of the story really amazes me. Not only that, but the graph just leaves me in awe. 5 out of 5 stars. It really changed me as a person.",Positive,254,49
John Samuel Suico,2020-09-28 20:50:56,"It's absolutely phenomenal. The storyline is well written, and it's incredibly enjoyable to play and get to know the characters. Interaction with the environment is weaved into both the game play and the story progression (NPC dialogues change) which maximizes immersion into this beautiful world. Artstyle and character design is just fantastic. I don't really have enough words for all of it. You guys deserve all the support you can get, kudos to the developing team for such a wonderful game. ‚ô•",Positive,498,82
Sean Bainbridge,2020-10-11 11:20:39,"Such an awesome mobile game. Better on the PC though, I've been running it on decent settings on an old PC so it is possible. Amazing graphics and art style. Good characters. Don't need to pay to play which is nice. You get a ton of free stuff and I'm sure that will continue, in order for f2p to exist. It's definitely a must play game if you want to play something that isn't a dumb idle game or huge boring grind. I'd definitely go for PC over mobile. Or try it on PS4 it looks great on there too.",Positive,500,100
Itashi Syuki,2020-10-21 23:56:44,"10/10 adventure game probably the best I've played out of any. This game actually has working mechanics and its not just the storyline you have to complete, there's so much to explore and so many battles to fight. Overall, the best game I've ever played.",Positive,254,45
Mark LawX,2020-09-28 22:18:35,"5 star of course! This is my first day of this game and so far it did not disappoint! The open world is HUGE and so many things you can do with it! If I have to nitpick, they need to work on the camera a bit, when the character is jumping, the camera should be following with a delay to make it feel like jumping instead of looking like the world is moved to the player. Other than that, pretty good game, and chill, which is what I like than that competitive Honkai. Recommended",Positive,479,95
Sean McGoey,2020-10-17 12:22:03,"Incredibly fun and polished. I play mainly on PC but hopping over to mobile is surprisingly smooth. Gorgeous to look at, fun (and free!) to play, and lots to do. Ignore the complaints about the ""end game"" grind; the game isn't finished. Only two of seven regions are accessible with updates coming each month. The gacha rates are godawful but you don't need a team of five-stars to complete all quests and battles. Really looking forward to seeing how this game develops over the next few months.",Positive,496,87
Michael Scott,2020-10-01 16:39:55,"This is, by far, the best Mobil RPG I've ever played. The story and voice acting are fun and engaging. There is a true variety of things you can do in game (not just using the same game mechanic 3 different ways). The puzzles are awesome, you actually have to calculate your actions in combat, and you choose how hard you want the game to be through your own decisions and not some arbitrary game mechanics.",Positive,407,76
Bahaeddine Chouchene,2020-10-20 21:34:45,"So far so good, the graphics are amazing the story too, gameplay is full of action and honestly didn't play a game like this for quite a while. Keep it up keep up the good work but please don't ruin the game with the micro-transactions. With love from Tunisia.",Positive,260,49
Nexro,2020-10-19 01:37:35,Best graphics ever idk how this is free but I'm not complaining I've been looking for an open world mobile game like this for a long time this is definitely the best game in the world the game play is good and I love how you can unlock new landmarks and teleport there it makes the game alot more interesting and you can go certain places to get new weapons or even fight monsters and open chests this just the best game ever,Positive,425,83
Mauri-Mattias L√§√§nesaar,2020-10-03 04:41:05,"Genshin Impact breaks the mold of other mobile games in the same genre, it's not pay-to-win, playing for you, low-effort stuff, Genshin Impact is a gorgeous game with an interesting story and fun combat and movement. I love it, it completely drew me in and I will definitely play it more. I found it has a PC version with cross-saving as well, so that's probably going to make me put in tens if not hundreds of hours quickly. I'm looking forward to see the pc graphics and where it goes from here.",Positive,497,92
Samantha Gobert,2020-10-08 17:03:02,"So much more than a BotW copy. Beautifully designed game with exquisite attention to detail, great story, and creative fighting mechanics. Even if it is a gacha game, I'd honestly be happy to spend a few bucks here and there, since this would easily be a $50+ console game. So far, how ever, I've been able to play for hours and hours without feeling stuck or like I NEED to spend money to enjoy or progress in the game.",Positive,420,79
waaathefirst waaa,2020-09-30 07:28:46,"Love the game so much. Its open world, anime, and a gacha game. The world is absolutely gorgeous. It's on mobile and pc which means when I'm not at the house I can play on the go like when they release events and im not home and so far no bugs and the graphics amazing. I love the variety of characters with gears and weapons this is the anime rpg that I like. J also like how they got an English cast as well.",Positive,410,84
Dieshouri,2020-10-06 01:21:04,"Having put 300+ hours into BotW, this definitely has a lot of similarities and BotW elements put together. The stunning console-like graphics, gorgeous gameplay, wÃ∂aÃ∂iÃ∂fÃ∂uÃ∂sÃ∂ characters with chests and thighs, the amount of content, a co-op feature, this game is far too good to be a BotW clone. It blows me away thinking that this, a mobile game, could even be compared to a console game like BotW. 9/10.",Positive,405,69
Linh Chi Tr·∫ßn,2020-10-26 09:18:09,"I love almost everything about this game so far. The issues I'm not contented with I've already suggested in the surveys. The game is new and there's plenty room to improve even further, so we'll see. For starter it's already polished enough xD",Positive,244,43
ThatBroAdam,2020-10-02 00:59:40,"My only complaint is that every cut scene the game cannot keep up with itself, the audio and video de-sync the video stops all together and then the audio crackles, exiting the app and re-entering it helps briefly. Other than that the game itself is truely one of it's kind, superb graphics, easy to learn controls, open world adventure, amazing quests and side quests. It has a story that is honestly a blast to follow. I would give this a 9/10. If the cut-scenes werent so bad it would 100% 10/10.",Positive,499,91
Kazaku Akigaya,2020-10-01 17:47:09,"It's been so long, since the last time I got so damn excited from playing an MMO, and trust me this game right here is an ideal open-world RPG. The staff of the game; guys hands down I respect u not only the game's overall structure, the art and animation but also the voice acting, music, storylines,etc u ppl went full over-kill on it to make this lovely world of urs'( Íàç·¥óÍàç)",Positive,376,72
Seema Varma,2020-10-14 23:18:14,"I really love this game! Ive been looking for something like this for a long time and am so happy to find something with good graphics qnd story with amazing game play all together. The only thing I wish was to be able to sync my account to my ps4. But oh well, other than that this is so much fun especially during this current lockdown.",Positive,338,66
dave wood,2020-10-07 16:42:06,"Just played for the past hours and all I can say is this game got that standard AAA open world game feel. The graphic(use the latest flagship to use the highest setting), gameplay, and music is all top notch, but the voice acting for English feels a bit stiff, while the Chinese & Japanese feels more natural(i only know English). I don't mind paying to play this game but they using gacha system which can be addictive ‡≤†_‡≤†",Positive,423,78
Vasu mohite,2020-10-05 08:45:10,"Absolutely beautiful game. From the beginning, this game will show you gorgeous character models, environments, and you have all the freedom to swim, roam, and climb as much as your stamina let's you. Oh the audio, it was just beautiful. The story as well! I wanted to finish prologue first before starting my work, but it got me real hooked. Ah, but for some reason, cutscenes are very buggy. Images don't move and transition, the audio becomes gritty. Pretty much the only problem I'm having.",Positive,494,85
Maxis Skyter,2020-10-01 19:47:13,"I'm a huge fan of animes, especially fantasy ones. I love the style, the atmosphere and the open world exploration, you feel like you have seen everything, but the map is so big that you can't help but keep running around even when your main objective is sidelined by something else and enemies to fight with. Best part is that the game is not pay to win. I recommend the game to anyone who wants to kill some time. By some time I mean hours, good job guys.",Positive,457,88
Frags,2020-10-02 17:05:24,"First of all, I really enjoy this game, it offer a lot of content than other game. But the game still not polished. At PC I encounter some cutscene bugs and camera issue. First, cutscene bug is when after loading screen it pop up the scene and then go black screen again and that kind of drawback when I already immerse into the game. Secend, when I finish combat, the camera will auto zoom into my chars and can't zoom out. So I hope the devs can fixed it ASAP.",Positive,462,90
Hezkia Anugrah Rompas,2020-10-04 23:09:56,"For being a game that just released, it's phenomenal! I love the aesthetics and how the elements react to each other. The world is also really vast, so fun to explore! Although, a game doesn't come without flaws. You do require quite a good system, if not, expect lags (speaking with experience, but got over it). It also eats up quite a lot of your storage space, so don't expect to play if you don't have enough space. Tldr; If you have a good system, definitely give this game a go. PS play on pc.",Positive,500,95
David Huang,2020-09-30 22:39:56,"Stunning game, this is a true example to a open world rpg and how it should be like. I use a s20 ultra so running high quality with 60fps is not problem. The vast options you have in this world and the little details make this game astonishing. I would highly recommend anyone who say phone games are not enjoyable to give this a try. This same game is also avaliable on the PS4 but no different on the phone. This game takes a big step on how phone games should be from now on. Big yes from me!",Positive,495,99
Esteban Gonzalez,2020-10-27 00:49:31,"The Gacha rates are horrible, and I do mean abysmal. Why still 5*s then? Well the game itself has some great gameplay, interesting features, fantastic characters, a compelling story, and overall is a great experience. They do gift you some better units along the way too, making it almost completely free to play viable. Plus it's really addicting. I reccomend it completely though fix your Gacha system as well as energy consumption!",Positive,434,72

At first I was worried because it seemed like a lot of reading but they hsve voice overs, cut scenes and even options. I haven't stopped playing for the last 5 hours. I love how things have reactions also how you can do dungeons, main story ect its just so great best mobile app I've seen in all my years.",Positive,458,88
This is gunna be a channel,2020-09-30 23:24:31,"This game may not seem like it at first but it is a huge step forward in mobile gaming and blurring the line between mobile and console. It is an open world single player game with some light dungeon coop so far, but I'm sure with the money the devs will be raking in for this title it will get even better. But as far as mobile action rpgs go, this game is one of a kind in sound, control, art, and design. There is no way someone could rate less than 5 stars beyond phone issues.",Positive,481,97
Sushi Roll,2020-09-28 11:43:05,"There's no way this is a mobile game. This game looks amazing, feels amazing, and sounds amazing. It's very difficult to get me to like English voice acting, I didn't even like the My Hero dub, but this is magnificent. The game looks like it should be on a PC and the controls feel perfect, I bet a controller would feel a bit nicer, but hey, it IS a mobile game. Absolutely fantastic, 10/10, best mobile RPG ever.",Positive,414,78

Zyo Ahmed,2020-09-29 11:34:08,I'm sure it's been said countless times already but it doesn't seem like a free mobile game.

Gaige Pattie,2020-10-06 10:49:40,"Beautiful experience so far, UI could use some tweaking though to make it better, for me anyways. I have a Sony Experia 1 ii, which uses the 21:9 aspect ratio, and the controls are not ideal for this setup as my fingers cover more screen than necessary. Pulling the controls out closer to the edges would greatly improve the experience, if possible.",Positive,349,62
G-Off Grimes,2020-10-05 18:44:07,"I have to admit I am truly amazed by this game. It's taking the aspect of everything that I expect in action style RPG, MMO, anime, Skyrim all into one. Beautiful sceneries all around the world is huge. The voice-overs of the characters are so superbly done. Tons and tons of quests. Just so much to do in this game. One thing I love about this game besides all the game lol. Is the fact that none of the quests actually repeat like in normal MMORPGs. Great job to the developers of this game.",Positive,493,94
Lynxenx D,2020-10-01 02:49:02,"An absolutely incredible feat of game development. This game feels like what Breath of the Wild could have been if it were better. It's a triple-A gaming experience on android. It's the most polished, incredibly well designed game I have ever played on a phone. The animations, art style, gameplay, voice acting, story and graphics are fantastically well done. There are a few minor bugs, and you need a fairly high end phone to run it at max settings, but those two problems do not harm the game.",Positive,497,88

Pheonix Mighty,2020-10-04 06:01:14,"Its an amazing game!. I am so addicted to it, that I don't want to ever leave! It does take up all of your battery though. Yesterday, I was playing the game and my phone was fully charged. Later that day, after 1hour it was at 20%!. This is not a multiplayer game though. You cant really play with other players, but their are villigers!. This is NOT a dentist game, although you can feed your players to get them all ready and fixed!. Heh, this game is off the HOOK, totally recommend this game!",Positive,496,95
Suminom -,2020-10-07 15:34:27,"I believe this game would be better without ""Original Resin"" (energy system). Gacha rates and prices are ridiculous and mostly designed for whales, not casual gamers. You might not get anything worthwhile for the amount of cash equivalent to a triple A title, thus I won't spend a dime. Guess they need to make their money somehow though. It's still a great free-to-play experience. I just hope that they will improve benefits to co-op mode, since it's hardly worth it right now.",Positive,479,82
Haze,2020-09-29 20:36:15,"Great game! Controls are nice, graphics are amazing, has some great attention to details, very well done for miHoYo!

Overall great game but needs a bit optimization and adjustment.",Positive,356,59
Mankey Faces,2020-10-07 01:11:09,"The graphics and gameplay are just amazing! Honestly wasn't expecting much at the start, but wow has this game blown my mind! There is so much to explore and so many characters to play with.

The game has to just released, but I know the game can go very far!",Positive,435,85
Reuel Jimenez,2020-09-30 12:18:30,"Great Gameplay. The graphics are awesome and as someone who like playing PVE and open world, this takes the cake.

THANKS FOR THE GAME! will support it in the long run :)",Positive,359,65
Ioannis Smyrillis,2020-10-04 04:34:21,"The sheer detail and beauty of this game's world is something ive never seen on mobile and is comparable to some openworld pc games.

Luna Kelly,2020-10-15 09:04:52,"Breathtaking. I can't believe that this gorgeous open world game is free on mobile. Even on the lowest graphics settings, the views are beautiful and I love seeing the changing weather! Fight controls are easy and the storyline is so cute. Can't wait to try the PC version too! Only changes that I'd love to see is a trade option between friends in co-op, a teleport option to reduce travel time and allow people to open boxes in another friend's world, at least for the bosses.",Positive,478,86
ShinPachi The Straight,2020-10-09 21:41:18,"You'll want to consider making sure that you're priorities are set when you launch the game, to pace yourself well and to plan your resources even better.

Hueseng Xiong,2020-10-04 17:57:18,"I really like it. No necessary purchases to play nor auto-navigation and auto-fight, lots of storyline that makes senses and additional quests to help you level properly, and the graphics are amazing.

Totally Oblivious,2020-10-19 17:34:16,"Amazing game, give it a try and you won't regret it. I was surprised at first thinking it just wouldn't work out on mobile cause of the sheer amount of controls, but it really does. Game has triple A elements to it, overall I give it a 5.",Positive,238,48
Romit Pal Chowdhury,2020-10-09 19:02:03,"Breath taking game. Never experienced such an implementation for mobile coming (even free). I know some might call it a clone, but take my word for it that this game takes a different turn on everything other than the basic mechanics and world format. The attacks are super satisfying as they flow like a fluid. Definitely recommend you to give it a try, and believe me when I say that you won't regret it if you are a mobile gamer like me",Positive,439,82

KlƒÅvs Zandersons,2020-10-02 00:29:03,"Graphics: Decent on mobile, also look solid on the PC client as The art style and character designs are notable for their quality, just like in Honkai impact.. Gameplay: Similar to Honkai impact, but focuses on element combining instead of dodging. The element combining system can have some interesting effects, like launching a tornado over fire will turn it into a fire-infused tornado Game's structure that of an open world sandbox or MMO, there's no base building or other stuff you've come to expect in gacha(thus far at least).. Sound: OST is relaxing, very fitting for the tranquil world the game takes place in. English VA is alright, won't make your ears bleed. Business model: Typical gacha mechanics for characters and gear, but at least early on it hasn't been mandatory, and the game gives you some free rolls for goodies starting out. Give it a try, it's at least worth that.",Positive,890,152
C. Serrano,2020-09-28 19:33:34,"Absolutely beautiful game. From the beginning, this game will show you gorgeous character models, environments, and you have all the freedom to swim, roam, and climb as much as your stamina let's you. The combat is pretty fun so far. Being a ranged class for example, it's really smooth having the option to break into a sprint to get some space and have the choice to really aim your shots (with a gyro aiming option) to do some damage. I genuinely can't get over how pretty this mobile game is.",Positive,496,90
Ocean Peng,2020-10-07 00:57:06,"Beautiful and detailed graphics and have a proper storyline with good flow. I haven't seen any mobile games up till now that come as close as this game, I have to say great job to the developers! Only problem is they can add customize the controls and it would be better. The archers aiming are just terrible. Up to now the game have been quite generous too! Will definitely support the developers. So far nothing to complain about. But will update if the game goes to heavily on money grinding!",Positive,495,90
Krisna Bour,2020-10-08 14:43:22,"It's actually pretty good and runs on my phone without lag surprisingly. For a gacha game it actually has a cohesive story plot, a thought out setting, and reappearing side characters. It's worth checking out since it's free and so far I never felt like it was a pay-to-win game at all. My only issue is that the intense high tier cutscenes don't load, but the other minor cutscenes load fine. This game is a game changer in the free to play games genre.",Positive,454,84
Haruto Kissey,2020-10-01 07:56:33,To me this is the first open world game I've ever played on a mobile! To think it's possible to even play such beautiful game that's seems so big in a mobile version! I was hoping Tales of Crestoria to be an open world game like they traditionally do. But you guys pull off the impossible and what Bandai failed to do. And with that you guys deserve a 5 Star from me!,Positive,367,73
Roro potato,2020-11-13 02:22:38,"Thank you for fixing the lag, its just the sound is bugging me it keeps on lagging idk why but I'll give you 5 stars on this cause you really fixed the lag :)",Positive,158,34
iozy,2020-10-13 05:38:49,"I think this game is well built with cross server between android and PC. I love the gameplay, graphic, also the combat. Maybe you'll grind character, but it is worth with the story you can get. Also this game can be played with your own pace. There is co-op function when you reach lv 16. When you explore, maybe you'll find some minor bug. But, its ok, i still can play the game. Overall, recommended game.",Positive,408,76
Amri Hassan,2020-10-05 04:17:37,"Oh my, Mihoyo this is a masterpiece! I love the world, story, gameplay, mechanic, characters and everything are well polished. I've yearn this kind of satisfaction when playing mobile game for long and it is Genshin Impact is the first be able to do so. Looking forward for how this game will be going in the future. And yes, tech otaku saves the world.",Positive,353,64
Sean Ashton,2020-10-13 18:30:51,"Devs obviously took a lot of inspiration from botw, but an amazing game overall. Story isn't too exciting and dialogue can be long at times but game play makes up for it. One of the only gotcha games that dont require you to buy stuff constantly, though there isn't too many wish draws to spend money in anyway. But do keep in mind the game is very demanding, with anything but recent flagships being a bit chopy.",Positive,413,77
Nauvez Whreen,2020-09-28 22:04:20,"This game is so amazing the graphic is so beautiful, game mechanic is great, and maybe this game is not really pay to win to progress the story. Because this is the first version of game I can tolerate there's a bug such a incorrect shadow on windmill, after you complete a quest rarely but sometime the npc will spawn 2 of 'em. I hope there's a patch sooner, because every 15 or 20 minutes playing the game is freezing but a few second later it will resume on my Xperia XZ Premium.",Positive,482,93
Cat ‚Ä¢,2020-09-30 19:54:52,"Not at all what I was expecting, pleasantly surprised! The graphics are fantastic, as is the soundtrack. I love the ability to switch between characters as this gives you more variety in play. The gliding and free running aspects are second to none, there aren't any mobile games out there that achieve what Genshin has achieved. Not money hungry game, just hours of fun, what's not to like!",Positive,391,68
Wolfex Hypers,2020-10-08 23:29:36,"Great game, great graphics, great effects, great combat system, great music, great upgrading system. A lot of people have been complaining about their game crashing and laggy a lot and its really unfortunate. It's sad to see people just 1 star this game just because they can't play the game or complaining about the gacha rates too low or only 5 stars are the only useful one. Clearly they don't know anything about the game. All characters are useful lol. Love this game.",Positive,473,83
Shift Lock,2020-09-29 07:14:23,"This game is awesome. Straight up played in my PS4 and the experience is breathtaking. Tons of features to enjoy and the exploration is great. I tried playing on my android phone but the specs doesnt match the minimum requirements, but still playing on a console feels a lot more intuitive and easy to control. There are frame drops on some regions but all in all its a great game considering it is a gacha game.",Positive,412,76
Jacob Levin,2020-10-06 11:45:16,"This game is absolutely amazing as a FTP and truly is one of the few games on google playstore that isn't a money grab. The gacha system is also very accessible if you chose to grind, but as always you can pay if you are too lazy to grind. The only criticism I have for this game is occasional lag and frame-rate drop, however, that's also an issue on my end. Overall I can't wait for the game to add more content! FYI, Paimon is the best guide ever!",Positive,450,89
Ryan Josh Rabino,2020-09-30 13:54:05,"The game is overall great with it's graphics, gameply, and mechanincs. Although the game requires patience it is still a very fun and exciting game. The only issue I have is the transportation, the only way for you to explore new territory is through sprinting and teleporting nearby waypoints, so i think you should add a mount system for a more convient way of transportation.",Positive,378,65
Mikatakuzu Jinokiteshifu,2020-10-15 09:34:42,"I personally love games like this, the ability to climb the trees, buildings, mountains, boats, almost everything is climbable. Another thing I really like, would be the day/night cycle and how the weather changes from sunny one moment, to rainy at another. One thing that I do feel is lacking though, (unless it's further in the game and I haven't found it yet), is owning a house, and being able to decorate it to our liking. This game deserves its 5-stars.",Positive,459,81
James Just,2020-10-01 19:21:31,"I had my doubts regarding the initial rumours of this game, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it enjoyable and engaging. My mobile's a bit old, so my experience has been a bit laggy, but even on the lowest settings I'm enjoying myself and am still shocked that this is a free game. I hope there are more character customization options in the future (my friend refuses to play until that happens), and I'm dying for a Switch release. Anyway, thanks for the hard work. Can't wait to buy stuff",Positive,496,91
Justin Menec,2020-10-05 19:10:55,"Absolutely incredible that this is not only free to play, but also a mobile game. Hats off to Mihoyo for actually giving the gaming community a game that is so friendly to all different types of players on any platform. This game is easily worth at least 60$ and yet has it all for free. As for what it's like? Think full open world anime rpg that encourages exploring the massive world and finding all its secrets while leveling your characters and becoming strong enough to tackle new challenges!",Positive,498,89
Tommy Pham,2020-10-07 00:56:22,"I can say playing this game was a bit of a slow start, but once progress farther into the story you can do so much more. I started playing this around 7pm, by the time I notice the time, it was 2am in the morning. My only concern is the button layout is a bit too close together. I find myself clicking the jump button more often then the attack button when I am in battle. That's why I giving a 3 star for controls. If I was able to change the layout then it would have gotten a 5 star instead.",Positive,495,102
Tatum,2020-09-30 10:36:49,"I was never able to truly enjoy 3D games such as this, and this is the first time I actually LOVE this kind of game; the storytelling, quest, gacha, and all at once, in this kind of style. This is even also the first 3D game I don't even click on auto out of boredom, I been doing everything on my own because I was completely immersed in this game! But the negative part of this game is the download took forever, it really hurt the points of this game, but it's worth it, I promise!!",Positive,485,96
Snn Vlsc,2020-10-07 19:50:36,"Tbh, Genshin Impact were one of the best games I have played in a long time. To better describe it, Genshin would be like Zelda breath of the wild if you turned it into anime. The map may be big, but the game was designed in a way that makes it rewarding to actually explore. Basically, I love this game and would recommend you to give it a try. Also the best part about this game is that you can play it in different platforms, from computers to ps4. 10/10, very epic game!",Positive,474,93
Stephen Yap,2020-10-08 19:52:23,"Great game! I am a hardcore fan of open world and RPG games and this game is both. The graphics, map, the storyline would be awesome if there were actually more but I know it will have updates. The only concern I have is about the 60fps setting. My phone's heat rapidly increases when I turn on 60fps. Hope this would be fixed but all in all a great game.",Positive,355,70
Kiss Mark Fernando,2020-11-10 21:31:50,This game is really awesome when i first enter the game i feel the thrilled because i know that this game is very good from the very beginning it looks so nice the graphics the story every thing and even the map this game is 1 of the most beautiful games i downloaded so far so i leave it here 5 star i really like the game thanks for this awesome game Wohoooooo!!! This game is freaking awesome üî•üî•üî• been playing this since i downloaded this game its super cool again thanks Mihoyo for the game,Positive,494,96
dexter oreo,2020-10-11 04:26:51,"This has been a pleasant surprise but the resin system is too unfriendly. Open world exploring should be slightly more rewarding. This will bring in more players. The cooldown of resin doesn't fit in with this open world. Besides that the soundtrack, graphics, and gameplay are all amazing. This is coming from someone who makes an effort to complete every game on Console/PC.",Positive,376,63
Ryan Sanders,2020-10-06 22:48:48,"I legit thought this game was gonna be like the rest of the cash grab gacha games out there but I was surprised that it isn't. Yes it still a gacha game, but it gives me a breath of the wild feel with the exploration and cooking. Paring the action combat system with the many characters is definitely a plus and makes this game a must try. It's also cross-platform you know",Positive,373,72
Carlos Estrella,2020-10-11 19:13:54,"This app plays like a console game; it really is amazing. It isn't the first mobile mmorpg game, but, a new bar has been set for all others. The stories are detailed and fun to be a part of, the combat system is very dynamic, once you learn the element relationships and mechanics. Mihoyo has been generous, but, my one concern is the gatcha. Less than 1% for a 5 star unit/weapon isnt good. 4 stars are really good, and some are better than 5 stars, but this should change. Love the game overall",Positive,496,94
Tristanto Kurniawan,2020-10-01 12:17:33,"Honest Review: 4.5/5. Stories for me is a okayish. I love the music and voice actor/ress. Game running smothly on my potato phone but for FMV is sluggish. Game play is good, explorable, also game mechanic is very creative. Gachas is very low rate 0.6% for 5 stars. Right now not having trouble fighting boss or enemies, so I think it is not a P2W. And this game is enjoyable to play single player, or playing with friends. Not forcing play it as MMO is a big perks for me.",Positive,472,90
Abigale Rumma,2020-09-30 04:57:42,"If you enjoyed LoZ:BotW then I would recommend this game as it shares many of the se elements. When I first saw it I assumed it was another 3d mmo that you could leave running in the back ground while it played itself, al the while asking for you money for pets or mounts, but this game shows promise, and the few microtransactions there are, are fine. I fully support this game, I'm heavily enjoying it and look forward to any farther news or updates about this game.",Positive,468,88
Xiing,2020-10-06 16:16:06,"If you can run it, theres no other game for mobile better than this. Also, is a game with a lot of gameplay with a promise of constant updates FOR FREE, the gacha is just an extra, you can enjoy the story, the graphics, the environment and the music. If youre lucky enough to get a 5* you will be more happy, but without them youre still gonna be fine. 10/10 on launch, hopefully it will stay like this.",Positive,403,79

Creative Writer,2020-10-13 09:13:50,"This game contains a really cool open world that you can explore, which lots of neat little extras to go along with it. You can glide, cook, forge weapons, and more! As for the battle system, it is real-time and element based, paired with an experienced-based leveling system and various characters you can choose to use in battle. The world also holds culture and lore that you can explore, and there's many hidden secrets waiting to be found.",Positive,444,78
Gabriel Abreu,2020-10-18 11:07:27,"The game is great, it reminds me of breath of the wild. Of course no one likes the gacha like summoning system but I can deal with it. The multiplayer is not too good because only the host of the world will gain any items if friends play together.",Positive,247,49
Safiena,2020-10-07 18:11:48,"There's a little bit of a problem when i wanted to change the character, it always stuck and I can't press another character for different element (PLEASE FIX IT) I love this game, the story, background music and graphics are superb, and there's a lot of mission to accomplish, i never get bored with it because there's various type of mission (and not just only killing the hilichurls) but i hope in the near future update, there's a customization features for the characters.",Positive,477,83
Daniel Paterniti,2020-10-22 14:33:21,"Great open world game similar to Breath of the Wild on Switch. I like the elements skills and being able to switch characters while out in the world.

Been Jammen,2020-10-06 14:50:24,"A Dauntingly Ambitious Free-to-Play Game, and it Sticks the Landing. This sets a new standard for free-to-play games. miHoYo has crafted something very special here. Yes, it takes inspiration from Breath of the Wild, but it refines the formula and takes away what didn't work for everyone. The English voice cast is top-notch, music is beautful, graphics are very pleasant, and there is an overwhelming amount to do without having to pay for any of it. It's a simply amazing experience.",Positive,486,81
The Keys,2020-10-01 08:15:42,"Great And fascinating Game ! What Can I say is I truly immersed by the world, the system, interaction at npc, character, story, physics, and Everything I thinküòÅ.

Been playing for 3 days since the release, and I don't suffer any bug :) Love it !",Positive,344,67
Captain Wet Beard,2020-10-01 14:58:17,"The experience feels a lot like Breath of the Wild, and thats coming from a life long LoZ fan. The devs really nailed the sense of wonder and freedom to explore. I could spend hours just wandering around and seeing what I can find. The different characters feel unique, and require very different play styles in order to thrive. I highly recommend this game, it may be free but it feels like a triple A $60 game.",Positive,412,77
Gita Gumirika,2020-10-02 22:56:52,"Such high-quality game that I respect Mihoyo so much for giving it free to play.

Antony Brown,2020-09-29 01:43:13,"I'm going to go ahead and say that I've only played for a few hours, but I am extremely impressed with this title. I've also played Honkai Impact but I can say that they are nothing alike (this is good thing). Everything in this game is true to form for mIHoYo...top line production for everything--animation, music, art, voiceover, attention to detail some of the best. The world is truly OPEN and explorable. I am a very old school RPG player and have logged years into games such as Final Fantasy XI, XIV and many others (too many to mention) and I can honestly say that this feels very fresh and exciting even to me. The game presents encounters and events in like a D&D session in that they feel unexpected and thrilling. Players that are willing to explore the world will be rewarded. Although there is basic quest waypoints, the game does not autopath you. There's a small golden sparkle path and a basic direction icon. One of the most amazing things is how you can interact with the world. You are able to chop down small trees, climb larger ones (helpful to reach fruit that's up high) climb mountains to reach higher areas, even climb over walls in the towns. You can harvest and hunt in this game (and also cook the ingredients), and I would not be surprised if fishing is in there because there are fish in the waters, but they are very hard to catch by hand. I could go on and on. Way surpassed my already high expectations. The gameplay itself seems pretty basic action RPG style (3 basic moves, with charge ups) but with time perhaps this will become more fleshed out. The English voice acting is actually very good, and that comes from someone that normally turns language settings back to original.",Positive,1716,309
keimacool 777,2020-10-10 05:34:12,"Great game... An open world RPG with a great emphasis in exploration, dungeon clearing and character based combat...

Dmytro Bulatov,2020-10-19 04:43:09,"Probably best game for smartphones at the moment. If your phone can actually run it. Have crossplay between PC, Android and iOS, which is super useful. There's no ads and game doesn't really force you to spend money, at least for first 15 hours.",Positive,245,44
Senpai,2020-09-29 04:51:41,"Amazing mobile game, haven't tried cross play yet but excited to. You've never played a mobile game like this, when it says open world, it means OPEN WORD. I actually had to uninstall then re install because I was dumb enough to run around ignoring the ""tutorial"" which is just the game showing you where to go.

There's some bugs and glitches here and there, but that can be fixed in the future updates, as long as they focus on customers.",Positive,499,93
Michael Walker,2020-10-11 01:39:01,This probably the only mobile game that I have ever played as much as console games. The challenge and characters are really well done.

PC version is obviously better but completing dailies and simple tasks on the mobile version are a breeze when I'm away from the computer.

It's massive, the art, story, world, and combat all feel so rewarding. It took me like 6 hours to get passed the prologue, there's just so much exploring and fun all around. It's been an overwhelming experience so far. I don't know if there has ever been another game quite this epic on the play store.",Positive,440,82
Crish Jocson,2020-10-05 16:58:24,"Graphics are stunning, gameplay is exciting, sounds for the game are well suited for the overall theme and the lifespan would keep you playing this game for months without getting bored.

And I hope there will be some improvement of the issue for the better game experience.",Positive,346,62
Louis Jones,2020-10-02 20:35:31,Great overall game. Good graphics and runs smooth. Fun open world and cool story. It is a gacha with low top tuer drop rates but u don't need to pull top tier units at all. Only complaint I have is that the co-op has a lot to be desired. There lacks quest functionality in co-op which I feel should of been added. Or maybe co-op side quests or something to do in the open world outside of the instance based stuff. Makes the game feel less fun playing with someone which is awkward.,Positive,482,93
Fuzaki's Project,2020-10-08 04:57:56,"I never played a game like this before.. So it's very Entertain for me off course. Graphics good, environment good too, gameplay and story also the best. But i guess it was the beginning for this game 'cause this game launched not long ago soo still have something to catch up with other games. I hope there will be more features that support player-player to play together.",Positive,374,67
Greg Brech,2020-10-04 10:13:43,"Honestly has been a great experience so far. 20 hours in and I've barely explored the map. Fun mechanics and a great art style. It's easy to call this a clone of other games, but what it really is, is a amalgamation of the great ideas other games had and crafted into this experience. Try it out, but be warned, it's very addicting.",Positive,332,63
Spencer,2020-10-06 22:16:40,"This is one of the most beautiful and in-depth games ive ever played on a mobile device. I love how deep and rich it is, i love the open world, i love the game play style and combat systems. My only suggestion would be the option to adjust the onscreen controls. I find myself pushing the wrong buttons, or attacking when i just want to adjust my camera.",Positive,354,68
Adam Jucha,2020-10-05 00:38:41,"So far, in two days, I'm quite pleased and impressed. Maybe I haven't hit a paywall, but there's no transaction encouragements. Climbing, swimming, using elemental combinations, and flying. All these things make this the best RPG for mobile I have played. I'm not posting this to get a game reward, this seriously plays like a console game, but on your phone. Its graphic intensive, so watch your battery life.",Positive,410,69
Anon Ymous,2020-10-06 14:15:42,"Wicked game! Graphics are top notch and even on highest settings at 60fps my battery life is quite good (s20 ultra 5g). Phone runs a bit hot at these settings but a cooling fan fixes that issue. I love this game, even with Paimon's annoying voice constantly yammering away. The story so far has me hooked and the world seems vast. The combat system is fun and responsive but my one gripe is that switching characters in battle can sometimes become unresponsive and leave you frustrated.",Positive,486,86
Brandon En,2020-09-28 15:36:07,Ignore the 1 star ratings. I should mention to say that for the 1 stars for being unable to play or complaining about storage issues should lose the right to write a review. Its more of a issue for themselves and not the games fault. This is a flawless game and I've had no issues. Can't wait to indulge hours into this game,Positive,324,63
Aaron Bredon,2020-10-16 11:21:01,"Great game. An open world rpg with lots of things to find. If you want to simply explore and have fun all day, you can. You don't need the top gacha characters to play the game well. The energy system is only for killing bosses/dungeons to raise adventurer/character levels faster, so there is no need to spend money there either. The only current downside is the story is not complete yet. But if you don't rush levels and story quests, that isn't a problem.",Positive,459,84
Charlie Morris,2020-10-05 18:56:41,"Believe the hype. The mobile port is great, and I have no problem transitioning to my phone to keep playing on the go. Graphics: 10/10 Music: 11/10 Gameplay 10/10 Story: 10/10 Voice Acting: 10/10 Fun: All of it. If you feel like you need to get specific characters, feel free to reroll, however, I haven't used a character I didn't like. This is a new standard for mobile games. The open world exploration is MASSIVE, and there are days worth of just exploring to be done, not including questing.",Positive,496,89
Max Truong,2020-10-01 05:17:14,"I have been waiting for this game since it first announced. The hype is real, the business model is fresh and unlike other mobile games, it has a great story and world and you can easily beat it without spending a single penny, with some limitations toward the mid to end game. I have a pixel 3a and it works well with lowest graphics and lock at 30 fps. Some random fps drops times to times but hope it get better with newer patches. Hope that they keep this business model and won't make it worst.",Positive,499,96
Daniel Flores,2020-10-06 02:33:24,"Absolutely fantastic. The attention to detail is really quite astonishing, especially considering this game is free; there are many Triple A titles out there that don't put this much thought or substance into their games. There is absolutely no reason you need to spend money to progress. The seamless transition between PC to Mobile is much appreciated. My only complaint is that every now and then, my sound gets distorted on my phone; I run the game at Max performance on my Note 20 Ultra 5G.",Positive,495,86
Peter Njeim,2020-10-06 12:23:14,"Yes, the graphics and world mechanics are a rip off from BOTW, but, its fighting mechanics and story are different enough that I'll give it a pass. This is literally a console game on your phone. If you play at highest settings and 60fps (I only have a 60Hz display so idk if it goes higher for high refresh rate screens), you will drain your battery in a literal instant. Playing at lowest settings at 30 fps still drains considerable battery, but it's still playable for 5 hours on a full charge.",Positive,498,92
Saad Omar,2020-10-09 05:36:35,Best free mobile game of its kind. This game has no business being free. The quality of the story and combat are excellent. The graphics are cutting edge for a mobile platform. The sheer amount of things you can do and enjoy without being impeded by paywalls unlike other games is what keeps me hooked. I can't believe how polished the game is. The fact that it allows crossplay is an extra boon. It constantly rewards you with free stuff so you dont feel left behind for not paying.,Positive,483,89
Lau Ra,2020-10-05 09:08:33,"I've honestly played a lot (maybe too many) mobile rpg games and Genshin Impact is most definitely top 3 if not the best out of all of them. There's tons of amazing stuff that the developers nailed really well but I must point out that the attention to detail is what trully makes a game and they didn't shy away from it at all which makes GI stand out in the over-populated mobile gaming industry. Great job developers, you have here something to be truly proud of!",Positive,466,87
Stillbjorn,2020-10-11 00:58:01,"The game has blown my expectations clear out of the sky; absolutely amazing details, from the graphics, art, and music, fun gameplay; closest thing to a complaint I have is that the controls are almost too sensitive, I plan on getting a controller to see if that helps, and the fact that I can play on the PC sounds awesome for when I'm home and don't want to waste my phone's battery/data.",Positive,390,72
William Winson,2020-10-10 22:16:55,"A great game. A really rare fine these days where almost everything requires in game purchases. In the game story is original enough and gameplay is solid(but might be better). The only thing that would like to have in this game(to the point that I will dish out real money if available) would be a good multiplayer system, that would be great with the open world map.",Positive,368,67
Ashix54374 Rfaiman,2020-09-28 19:57:52,"I only played this game for a day, and I have a lot to say. So this game does not feel and look like a mobile game, it feels like a game that you would play on console or pc. The main aspects of this game is an interesting open world with explorations, cooking, different types of enemies to fight. Now we come to an interesting part fighting, I just love all of this elemental interactions between characters and environment. Graphics of this game are astonishing. Just download, and see 4 yourself.",Positive,500,92
Nathan waters,2020-10-09 08:58:34,"The story is enthralling, the freedom is immersive and the combat is thrilling unique. I've played a lot of games and many of them felt and played the same with similar mechanics and storylines. While the story for tension impact isn't something one of a kind it does have a unique flare that gives it it's own taste. Speaking of which, cooking, fishing and foraging are something I've come to enjoy doing in the game. I see tons of potential in this one, hope others can see it to.",Positive,482,89
Paige Colley,2020-10-05 14:14:17,"Wow, amazing story, artwork and just everything about the game. There are no ads, the game is free with in app purchases which are completely optional and the game is just as good without. I'm obsessed with this game. 10/10 would recommend the download. Even the multiplayer in the game is awesome, great way to play as well. Good for when you need some company.",Positive,362,65
Giannhs Gionhs,2020-09-28 23:32:12,"Amazing game, very high-end specs, or my phone is just too old. Anyway, i would like to make a suggestion if you could, please listen its importan. What if you guys added a ""render distance"" setting? It would make the game playable even for low-spec phones and maybe bring more people to try out the android-ios side of the game. Thanks a lot, i have been waiting for this game for a long time.",Positive,394,74
New Me,2020-10-01 06:06:27,"This game is honestly awesome. You will find yourself many times playing it more then you intended. It's almost without a complaint, and even those that exist are minor. You can play on PC, PS4 and Mobile while having the same progression on your account no matter the platform. So my only complaint is that on PC you can't change your key bindings which can be frustrating. All in all, more then a solid game for a free to play game.",Positive,434,81
Zack Ov,2020-09-28 22:40:05,"Beautiful game and good voice acting. The game rewards you for exploring the world which is very nice and the combat system is a little hard but really entertaining. There are also many things you can do besides fighting like exploring, mining or cooking and the game rewards you for all of those. A lot of people are complaining about the 6gb required which is understandble so if your phone can't take this much gb I suggest you turn back.",Positive,441,80
Brandon Lew,2020-09-29 10:11:39,"This is what the mobile game market needed! We now have a huge benchmark for other companies to compare against because this is the first mobile game that truly takes itself seriously to show off what mobile gaming COULD be if companies try. The story is great so far, gameplay is butter smooth, and visuals are next gen for mobile, even low settings look great. The only thing I would like to see is more graphics optimization, on my G8X I can barely run this game smoothly with low settings and full resolution.",Positive,513,93
teen fulyx,2020-10-01 23:38:50,"I absolutely fell inlove with the game over the past two days, easy gameplay but hard leveling up system, so you can't really rush through it. It has a bit of Dragon Raja Vibes. But it's ultimatively better since you don't have to buy the Essentials! I love how you don't have to look at cool outfits you cannot afford but want, because there simply are none. Smooth Graphics and mix of easy and hard tasks. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for probably one of the best RPGs!",Positive,489,92
Paco The Taco Whisperer,2020-10-04 21:17:34,"Overall wonderful game that completely makes the most of each of its platforms. I never thought such a high quality and polished game experience could be brought to mobile, and on other platforms it's even lore impressive. I've gotten lost in exploration and picking exhilarating tactical fights with opponents that should clearly outmatch me. My only complaints is that sometimes the movement is a little too sensitive and I can't pet the dogs in Mondstat.",Positive,457,75
Minh Duc Nguyen Cao,2020-09-30 23:17:11,"Basically everything I asked for an action-adventure game. Aesthetic world, decent gameplay, waifus, AND adventure-packed. The immerse experience in this game is like a fresh wind out of the blue, feels so good just for wandering around, exploring. Thank you my past-self had invested money in Honkai Impact 3rd and other fellows (whales) to make this game come true. Don't sit there reading my comment, HIT THE INSTALL BUTTON ASAP!",Positive,432,70
xXDOtaku SekaiDXx,2020-10-04 05:03:43,"Its a good and fun game , and u dont get bored easily , but i have yet to understand why everytime i stick to the wall i climb , can't you just make it so that when someone jumps into the wall he starts to climb , i think it would be much better , i'll give this game a five-star rating anyways because im having fun playing it",Positive,327,70
Erick Tonatiuh,2020-10-04 12:25:26,"I loved this game. I honestly didn't expect much from it, but it surprised me completely. The only thing I'd complain is that it doesn't have joystick support on smartphone, it's a bit hard sometimes because you can't see where the attacks are coming from because of your fingers covering the screen. I tried to play with my Xbox one joystick using OTG port and mapping the bottons with Octopus, it worked but I didn't like the result, so I ended up downloading the game in my laptop.",Positive,484,88
Naruto Hinata,2020-09-29 03:02:06,"Straight 5-star without question. As always, nice graphics, combined with open-world and cross-platforming, very nice indeed. I like how we can quest together and party with our friends, but it might be better to lower the rank, so we can play with friends during the beginning, doing co-op story instead of grinding until rank 15. Overall it is good, but not suitable for low-spec devices, this app is heavy.",Positive,409,69
creo505,2020-09-28 22:58:21,"Considering I have a 2018 phone model I enjoyed it. Sometimes I experience lags especially for cutscenes, texts/subtitles that gets stuck in the lower screen, and some glitches. I really love the story, so much to explore, love the characters, tons of rewards and treasures to open, I wish you can make more badass skill animation and also more primogems to obtain, 10/10 really love this game",Positive,393,67
The Mr S,2020-10-07 11:27:58,"Very good graphics, very nice gameplay, interesting plot, kawaii charasüóø, I'ma be honest. This game is the best game on mobile so far, it's like playing zelda on a phone while the plot and charas are more interesting than zelda to me. The details are also amazing, like when it's rainy charas with cryo element can freeze or charas with electro element does more damage. Also what can you see, you can go there. This is not just a background thing, this is literally lit. BEST GAME ON MOBILE!",Positive,492,89
MasPlayEpic,2020-09-29 13:17:48,"I was hyped for the game to launch ever since I heard about the man smashing his ps4 because of this game. I will say that this game is simillar to breath of the wild but not entirely and its more like an inspired version of the game. The game is a blast and addictive! Even though it heats up my phone and drains my battery, I can't put this game down. I would play this on PS4 but my parents don't let me play on school days... So im glad to experience this wonderful game on my phone! Worth a try!",Positive,500,102
Jacob Hudson,2020-10-01 19:32:44,"I got hooked into this game right away! It has an amazing story with amazing visuals! It runs very smoothly on my phone, and is very entertaining. The only problem I have come across is I can't friend my brother... He's on the ps4 and in the game description, it states it is cross compatible and I can play with people on the ps4 or other devices. I don't know if this is a bug or a misunderstanding. In the end, I totally recommend this game to anyone who likes open world Games with a good story.",Positive,499,97
Arthur Cockfield,2020-10-05 02:18:50,"This game is blowing my mind! I never thought I'd see the day when I could play a game like THIS in my phone! The controls are good, the story is really interesting, the characters feel unique, the voice acting is on par with a AAA console title, the map is huge, there's so much to explore and do... There isn't enough room to write how good this game is in 500 characters! I'm seriously impressed!",Positive,399,76
Edwin Leong,2020-10-05 21:14:59,"Easily the best game of the year, if not the decade! It's easy to see why this game is so hype. The beautiful character style, gameplay mechanics, open-world exploration, well-written storyline combined with music probably composed by godly bards. It feels like the developers really put a lot of passion into this project and I'm loving it! The only negative point really is that I can never look at other games again as this game is just that good",Positive,449,79
TF Thief,2020-10-02 12:00:54,"It's literally ripping off the mechanics of Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild. Same sparkly items, same running insects, same stamina, same climbing, sprinting, same encampments and crates and boxes, little puzzles and challenges, and I hate that I love it. But the story is ACTUALLY intriguing the voice actors are GOOD the animation is wonderful.. it's only been like, 4 days and it's already #1 on the app store in adventure. Only thing I hate: you can't leave the app for 2 seconds or it closes",Positive,500,88
Dennis Lumi√®re,2020-10-14 05:49:21,"Amazing and beautiful game. There is room for improvement, but the development team seems dedicated and they listen to feedback. Can bring you hours of fun, just be careful if you are bad at self restraint, when it comes to spending money on gachas. I recommend playing with japanese voices over the english ones as well! However both are good.",Positive,344,60
End Storm,2020-10-13 08:36:18,"One of the best game on mobile.. or maybe the best üòÇ it have the botw vibes although the world isn't as alive as botw's but this is still a top tier open world.. the characters have great designs, THE MUSIC IS SOOO GOOODD!!!!.. The thing i love the most is this game is not pay2win cuz we could grind it all the way.. but at higher levels it's hard to get the currency to do gacha.. but i still love this üòÇ",Positive,406,83
Aizel Del Rosario,2020-09-30 21:14:50,"It has great graphics! The storyline is cool and the voice acting too. I love everything about it, lmao. I play this and HI3 which takes a lot of space in my phone but it's alright! The gameplay is really smooth, too. And also, I like that I can go wherever I want lmao I climb on top of buildings HAHAHAHAHA! Anyways, great game! I recommend playing it. I would rate it 10/10.",Positive,377,73
Tibo,2020-10-07 00:33:48,"The main story is maintained and our objectives are clear. Choices are here and sometimes matter and sometimes don't. The graphics are good and enjoyable, the designs of the characters are well made and easy to remember. The map is pretty big for an open world mobile game. Maybe a few things to work on for the devs, add more quests, and more mobs for us to have more divertissement and things to discover ! A solid 9.5/10 for me, so the game really deserves its 5 stars :) .",Positive,476,90
Drew de Mesa,2020-10-04 08:27:40,"Recommended to me by a friend. I was pleasantly surprised by how clean it looked considering it was on mobile. Then I thought that the game would get grindy and monotonous, which clearly wasn't the case. It actually feels like the time you've invested in quests add up to something and immerses you in the rich storyline. Not to mention the amazing character design and breathtaking soundtrack. Oh, and the Gacha system is quite forgiving in comparison to other games. An near-flawless game.",Positive,491,83
Armaan Boparai,2020-10-29 20:43:49,"It is very good game. i never played game like genshin impact in the android.graphics ,story, action and more every thing is in the games.it has some glichs and bugs i hope you will improve it very soon. The dragon mission is totally crached. But over all game is very good. Best game at now",Positive,291,55
Min Thit,2020-10-09 14:31:41,I have had the most enjoyment playing this game than any other. Though it's just starting so there isnt much content after a week or so. Being free is great for a teenager like me. Most games that I bought seem less worth than this game after playing this. I'n looking forward to the future updates and the new contents.,Positive,320,60
Arnob Ghosh,2020-10-08 18:45:38,"Totally excellent game with good graphics and amazing story..... The gameplay and the interaction between the elements is also really good. No complains there. But, while playing the game, the fps suddenly drops to totally unplayable amount, not to mention the occasional overheating.... Then let's talk about the Mora. Getting over 100k is really tough but spending it is really really easy.... So, try to implement quests which gives you more Mora or make things cheaper ( go with the first option)",Positive,500,82
Jonathan Muse,2020-09-30 02:46:30,"Best looking phone game ever, hands down. Very clean & crisp cell shaded anime style. It's available on ps4 & pc, so for them to put out a full console level title with cross play on the phone is an impressive feat in & if itself. The gameplay is a little simple, but tries on the complexity of the element system. So combat at face value is a hack & slash with some specials, but really is brought together by the elemental system & forming your team around the elements that synergies well together. Has a breathtaking open world with a lot of small things to do littered around. Definitely sets the bar high for any anime rpg on Android after this. 5/5 android game 4/5 console game. Either way a great game.",Positive,711,133
B-man N,2020-10-05 01:02:00,"Quite loving the game! The graphics are smooth, the combat flows freely leaving you the choice to ""main"" a character or combine elemental effects to become a maelstrom of destruction, and there is absolutely no p2w aspects at all! It feels similar to Honkai Impact in some ways, and that's all the better! Keep up the good work MiYoHo!",Positive,335,59
Leonardo Xavier,2020-10-07 20:09:10,"The moment I played this game, I couldn't stop coming back to it and got hooked for hours. Content is pretty much player discovered as things come and go from here and there. Game is filled with adventure and action with its immersive world and experience. Gameplay is simple and easy to learn and master. Graphics is acceptable for 4G although would be better if support would reach as further as possible. Story and lore is as deep as it should be. Above all else, I can't wait to see more of this.",Positive,500,93
Trobo TwoMage,2020-09-29 06:04:29,"This game is honestly amazing. Despite issues it may have, they will definitely be fixed in the near future. I personally have not experienced any problems so far. While there is a Gatcha shop. It doesn't seem like you are ever forced to spend irl money to earn anything it offers. Everything is obtainable by gameplay. The world is massive and the story has been very entertaining. Not sure there is any mobile game that could come close to how much this game contains at launch.",Positive,480,86
Charlie Turpin,2020-09-30 22:58:47,"Picture the love child of final fantasy and zelda. Its essentially breath of the wild but with a party system. This has to be one of my favourite games on android. Although it's not one you can just pull up when you're bored, you have to sit down and really get into it. Only change I would make would be controller support",Positive,323,62
Tyler Dean,2020-11-01 22:23:19,"It's a very good game, just allow the drop rates for 5 star characters to be a bit higher",Positive,89,19
Roman Bishop,2020-10-01 15:42:19,"THIS is what I've been looking for in a mobile ARPG experience for so long! I'm at adventurer level 7 and so far haven't run into any auto-play nonsense, and each quest in the first levels seems to grant a new character. The gacha is there, but pretty unnecessary in the early game as far as I can tell. All of the characters are well thought out and the story is captivating, animations and art are amazing and fluid, and the voice acting is top-notch (especially for a FREE game)!!! I love it!",Positive,495,93
Lumi Hazar,2020-10-02 23:21:27,This game breaks all expectations of what a mobile game can be. This is truly an amazing adventure. The graphics and music are beautiful and the world is built wonderfully. Voice acting is fun and everything fits together. Being rewarded for exploration pushes me to find that chest or solve that puzzle one more time and I find myself spending hours on it. Even with the gacha elements I see this comparable to triple A titles in quality. Honestly stop reading reviews and go play!,Positive,482,85
Neoslayer PW,2020-09-30 11:45:33,"Beyond 5 stars. I have few very minor personal issues though. - It may be a bit difficult to pick up items when running. It would be cool if there was an auto pickup or something. - When doing idle animations, your feet no longer align with the terrain underneath - leaving the game or even turning phone power for a little bit makes you immediately disconnect, thus making you need to start any dungeon or temple all over.",Positive,423,79
Joe,2020-10-02 10:12:08,"Cleannnnnn, i was able to play on my pc and switch over to phone and they both had the same interface and no graphics downscaling which felt so good. Oh and plus bonus points on being an rpg where I read more than half the stories. On the other hand, some coop sort of missions other than world bosses and commisions might be interesting so that we can explore the world with friends and still get something out of it.",Positive,418,80
Jack H,2020-10-04 07:41:32,"I didn't want to review this too soon in the game, but that's just how impressive it is. The game even downloads in the background so you can do other things. The graphics are stunning. Controls are pretty simple Just overall exceeded my expectations right from the beginning. I just had to let others know that this game is definitely worth downloading.",Positive,354,62
Philip Cheezburger,2020-10-03 23:42:46,"Really enjoyed the JRPG mechanics in the game so far. Probably the best i've played on a mobile game. The min - max is not restrictive, combat mechanics are easy to learn and open up to a lot of combo techs. Every characters are viable in multiple situations which makes the gacha aspect worth investing into. Exploration is fun and engaging that it made me sink hours into the game just to explore the map. Excited to see how much the contents increase for time. Great job",Positive,473,87
Demetrius D'souza,2020-09-30 02:11:01,"I am a person who loves open world RPGs and this game has it all. From crafting, to magic, to even food system. I love the different interactions between different types of magic used. The monsters and enemies are very unique and fun to play with. Especially the bosses. Only one problem is the animation for the weapon seems a little off. Instead of being on the back it floats behind the characters. All in all I love this game.",Positive,430,80
synthwave04,2020-09-28 21:34:42,"This game has everything I was wanting and more, very much so exceeding my expectations. You're getting a pc level free roam mmo rpg on a mobile device. With that being said, dont expect to have a 50 dollar smartphone and be able to run this game well. I have a Samsung galaxy tab s6 and get pretty good performance on highest settings with medium being the sweetspot. Thank you so much for this experience, it truly made me happy to be able to play this game finally.",Positive,468,88
Katie Finley,2020-10-04 08:49:14,"so far its great honestly. unlike other games where they kind of force you to watch game play, this game allows you to actual interact with it with a great UI system! its easy and hard to play and that's how games are supposed to be. ive been actually suggesting the game to a lot of my friends because im impressed by the standards that were brought way up by this app game for app games.",Positive,389,76
Jehem Coladilla,2020-09-28 19:55:40,"For a free-to-play game, it has far surpassed my expectations, from graphics, controls, all the way to the gameplay. It all excelled in that field, there are some bugs that i noticed but since the game is still at early stages it can be forgiven as long as it gets fixed. I highly recommend this game if you're itching for an RPG game",Positive,334,63
TheLife4Jesus,2020-10-04 23:43:05,"Absolutely loving this game so far! Gameplay is smooth, visuals are nice. Story is well-written. Exploring is really fun. I've only made it to the first city, but so far I am very impressed. Loading time can be long though, but that's the only downside. I will edit my review once I've made more progress, but as of right now, I highly recommend playing this game!",Positive,364,66
Darkest Claymore,2020-10-05 14:23:36,"One of the best JRPGs I've played in recent years despite being F2P. The map is huge and the exploration is superb, offering you something to do at every turn. Some people are discouraged from trying the game due to the gacha, but you can easily get 100+ hours from the game as a F2P player using the free characters without feeling paywalled by anything. Not to mention, right now the game only has 2 out of 7 planned regions, so the game will be HUGE by the time they add eveything.",Positive,484,92
"Sir Ghostworth IV, Esquire",2020-10-05 16:36:53,"So far, best mobile game I've played in years. Only spent about 6-7 hours in the game so far and I already plan to play for the forseeable future. No in-your-face monetary options. The game runs smooth, the combat is fun and easy to pick up, and I appreciate the party implementation. The amount of freedom they give you is amazing, from climbing mountains, to using a freaking GLIDER, and no limit on exploration as to what I've seen so far. Highly Recommend.",Positive,460,83
A M,2020-10-06 02:06:50,"One of the best games I've ever played. Such attention to detail from the voiceovers to the storyline and the little mini quests spread throughout the map. Every characters is fascinating to work with and while I have a long way to go in getting hang of all the elemental details and characters switches in battle, I'm looking forward to figuring it all out. What a calming, well-constructed game, so glad I downloaded it.",Positive,422,74
Anime OP,2020-10-17 12:59:36,The graphic is outstanding compare to other mobile games and the control is easy to learn and understand . While the base game is good but you need to invest a lot of time to train your character and the gacha system are great and the pity system on wish can help you get a five star character or weapon . Unfortunately while playing this game my phone will get really hot and drain the battery really fast so i have to constantly charge my phone in order to play this game .,Positive,475,93
ŸÖŸáÿ±ÿØÿßÿØ ÿ≥Ÿáÿ±ÿßÿ®€å ÿßŸÅÿ¥ÿßÿ±,2020-11-13 23:23:02,Great game everything is excellent gust a little lag in game videos that I hope it will be fixed soon the game has a great environment and perfect characters the story of game is perfect as well it is obvious that a skilled team has wrote it because things that game character do is just like real human works and they even worked on word's emotions because you can sense feelings of character in her/his words At the end I should say that thanks for building this game,Positive,469,88
Golden Knight,2020-10-02 18:24:57,"Amazing game from every side, animations, characters, adventures along with secrets, dungeons, and of course the gacha system. Of course it's not good when you don't get your favorite characters but if you're lucky enough you will have your favorites. Still it's very entertaining just with the playstyle and animations, it's simply the first open world game I've ever liked this much, what an amazing game!",Positive,407,66
Some Cat On the Internet,2020-10-06 07:50:52,"This game is absolutely gorgeous. This game is one of the best if not the best mobile games ever. That fact that the devs actually put effort into this is amazing. Every other mobile game is just a cash grab. The gameplay is great, the graphics are beautiful, and most importantly, the devs are not trying to steal your money. The fact that this masterpiece is free amazes me. Its not the best game ever, but it is one of the best MOBILE games out there. Great job devs and keep it up!!",Positive,486,93
Rayhandi Naufal,2020-10-07 11:43:46,"Great game, great graphics, love it. The only issue for me is when i pick the male twin, the english dub keeps saying that i'm searching for my twin ""brother"", and keeps referring to the female twin as ""prince"". Will it be fixed soon? I don't really want to start over just to make the dub match the story, but it makes the story less enjoyable thinking that i picked the wrong twin to play with :(",Positive,398,77
GenezA,2020-10-04 11:17:12,"It's an open world game, and I really do love how there's just so much to do. Ah, the only problem I have is that it's too easy to level up, but not to ascend. By rank 5, my main character was max lvl, but I couldn't ascend him til rank 15- which I mean, isn't a big problem??? Just thought something y'all should take into consideration.",Positive,338,67
miranda stutts,2020-10-07 11:05:15,"I'm super addicted... I prefer PC or PS4, but mobile isn't bad. It's a bit of a pain to move, attack, and move the camera, but I can't think of a better way to do those things on mobile. There's a lot to do and the combat is simple but interesting. It's a well done game that I enjoy way too much. It currently isn't pay to win, but I haven't played further enough to see if it remains that way, but I don't think it will. You can if you want of course, but its nice that it doesn't make you pay",Positive,495,103
Hannah Adams,2020-10-16 05:40:55,"I imagine the game is easier to play on PC or console, but the mobile version is still very good. The movement controls give me some problems, but I feel like everything else is optimized well! The graphics are nice and I don't experience any lag or framerate drops and the story, world, and characters are all vibrant and fun and pull me in! I may end up switching over to the PS4 version, but I'm really enjoying the Android version of the game!",Positive,447,84
Sarthak Kumar,2020-09-30 04:56:19,"Great game!! Personally play on PC as my phone is not strong enough to run the game smoothly. So far the story, graphics, combat and exploration are all elements that have me hooked to the game. The low gacha rates are a slight turn off but the free characters you get are mostly good! Hope the devs put in a lot of love with future patches/events etc.",Positive,352,67
Leng Leng,2020-10-22 12:03:44,"hi, there's a problem that I've been experiencing on my oppo reno 3 pro. the faces of the npc,main char, etc are glitching and the NPCs neck is gone :_( and also the background is glitching although it is running fast my only problem is that it's glitching hope it can be fixed :_)",Positive,281,54
Arif Widmajaya,2020-09-30 08:23:24,"As expected from Mihoyo, this one really is awesome with its Open World setting, which i love so much. Thing is, the Android version feels laggy even with some flagship phone, and that made aiming harder especially with Bow. That is that but the gameplay and mission is above than your average game out there. For smoother gameplay though, the PC version is much better. By the way this game reminds me so much of the golden old Skyrim but in Anime style.",Positive,455,83
Charlotte Newbery,2020-11-11 11:13:42,Check it out so u can make friends also u will be allowed to level up and you can kill other creatures in the game it's really cool so please go get it,Positive,151,33

Ultimate Gammer,2020-11-06 20:16:44,Amazing game for mobile standard the graphics are so good that I can't even imagine it as a mobile game. Thank u guys for making this,Positive,133,26
Neha Chintala,2020-11-04 09:16:37,I love this game so much! I wish you could unlock characters without the gacha mechanic but its super fun either way.,Positive,117,22
Halotic,2020-11-02 02:36:44,Surprisingly good game. Has depth of full consol games I used to play around my FF/zelda days but on phone....getting used to mobile controls tho....lol yea,Positive,156,26

Mugilan E,2020-11-09 01:40:00,This game is awsome.. It has pc like gaming experience. The gaming story is awsome And the best part is it even works on my budget Smartphone.,Positive,142,27

Add Miricals,2020-11-15 23:04:05,"Loved the story and environment where character can go any coner of area he want even to the top of building , mountains just loves superpower really awesome game",Positive,162,29
Cody Geile,2020-10-15 01:26:53,Very pleased with this game. Previous edits deleted because all my gripes were solved in time. If you're having an issue with the game I recommend waiting and seeing if it fixes itself throughout the story because a lot of changes occur. This is by far the most innovative and fresh feeling mobile game I've ever played. its like if Zelda breathe of the wild met assassins creed with a hint of gacha gambling fun. Resources are obtainable for gacha mechanics for free so no complaints there either.,Positive,498,88
Gavin Salas,2020-09-28 16:28:10,"This is my second review on this game, my first review on this game is 5 stars. Now for my 2nd review. I love this game, love everything about it, however, I have only one complain, although, the game just released today, so that should be expectable but, there are cutscenes where it lags very much and there are other cutscenes where it doesnt lag at all, but most cutscenes, lags too much, that I cant watch the cutscenes at all, please fix that, I super love this game already. That's all for now",Positive,500,94
ShadovvWolfie,2020-10-02 16:44:35,"I am honestly surprised that this game is free. Though the lack of methods to atleast get some characters without rolling exists, it has overall been a reasonable experience. I feel this game has the potential to set a new standard for open world action games .It's co-op is implemented very well with minor flaws, which is no story content and p2-4 can't open/loot from open world chests and offerings. Also binds are good but re-binds would be better for PC/Controller.",Positive,471,81
Nathan Park,2020-10-07 21:22:08,Genshin is a great f2p yes it does take a while for you to get characters that you like. But I like how you don't need five stars to do damage. The main things are the items and the only one that you get from pulls are weapons. This game bring about the best gameplay with unbelievable graphics. With being able to crossplay on both PC and mobile.,Positive,347,68
Liam Giles,2020-10-02 17:45:35,"Just to clarify I've played this on pc and mobile and I got to say that they have the controls down pretty well on both, I don't feel like I'm lacking when I play on mobile. The combat is simple but satisfying when you start switching and creating elemental combos with the four different characters you can have on the roster. The world definately feels like BOTW but has enough to separate it as a unique fun experience, especially when being able to replay bosses & explore with friends.",Positive,490,89
Khurram Javed,2020-10-01 17:07:12,"A revolutionary game made for Mobile. The graphics, combat, world, and progression. It's all comes together into a masterpiece. I hope that Mihoyo keeps updating and keeps adding to this game. I wished that everyone was in the same world, I know you can do 4 player Co-op but seeing everyone around you doing there own quests and leveling has it's own charm and let's you interact with others. This game is still a step in the right direction. I am expecting a lot from mihoyo and am a fan now.",Positive,494,91
Burezu Blaze,2020-10-15 16:46:59,"Try it out, you will never know what the game has to offer if you don't. It have great graphics, top notch VA, great story animation. Unlike any other game that only offer you mindless visual novel with only shaking char as a sign of being attacked. That being said, do not forget that this is ultimately a gacha game. Try it out until the you clear out at least half the content, then judge if this game deserve your support, when they giving you a whole game just for free. Remember, a free game.",Positive,498,95
Oxymoron 428,2020-09-28 11:45:48,"Wow... I played this on PC first, and I literally couldn't believe it could be a mobile game. But I played it on mobile now, and I am blown away! The graphics are amazing, AND the gameplay is astounding (a rare combo). Yes, its 5GB, but its worth every byte. Play it on your PC or console if you must, but by all means, plaaaaay iiiiiit",Positive,336,66
Megat Zuqney,2020-10-07 10:38:48,"Totally fascinating! The graphic, the storyline and the game mechanic. everything is so high end quality for such a free to play game! I love it so much! *if anything that this game could improve, i would likely recommend to make it 'auto-loot' instead of having to spam-click on the screen everytime the item (a lot of item) dropped on the ground. Also it would be fun to add a new feature such as 'Fishing'. Every environment and different country will determine what kind of fish you get.",Positive,491,88
Don Rando,2020-10-03 11:01:57,"It has been 5 days of utter fun. Exploring, fighting, quests, collecting. Just unlocked co op. No need to spend money... but, job developers have done is just wow and worth dropping a few to them. Music(most games turn off), story(haven't skipped any dialogue), switching between my phone, tablet and PC depending on mood or location.",Positive,334,56
One-Legged Seagull,2020-10-26 11:09:26,One of if not the best action RPGs on mobile. Great graphics even on low. One problem though is that it lags even on low graphics. This game is really fun and I recomend it. Edit: the glitch has been patched and the game runs smoothly now!,Positive,239,47
apoorv gajbhiye,2020-10-01 02:09:48,"It's an awesome game. I really loved it. I really recommend this game. First it is totally free to play and even then you can earn nearly everything in the game. You can explore the vast world and there are so many things to do. The puzzles , the combat, the story and even the dungeons. There is always something to do. Really loved it.",Positive,337,65
vinayak sahu,2020-09-29 11:07:38,"I was eagerly waiting for this game and when It finally came out I was so stunned to see that they made it open world with a great story. The controls, story, gameplay, graphics and the mechanics are all great. The only thing that breaks immersion is how the camera suddenly faces down when we fall and stays at that angle. Overall mechanics of fighting is just awesome. This is truly a paradise for gamers.",Positive,407,75
Goopy-Sins,2020-10-01 17:15:07,"I expected this game to be like every other anime moblie fighting rpg game that lacked the rpg and forced clunked buttons on your screen, but I was pleasantly suprised when it had more rpg elements and is over all pretty easy to understand and get into. The climbing system, reminds me so much of botw that I kinda hope this game gets a sequel were you can built your character from the ground up. Its very fun and easy to get into and understand most of the story, even if you speed read through it.",Positive,500,96
Sidharth KM,2020-10-16 17:45:59,"This is too good to be mobile game, assuming you have a phone to support it. Massive open world, tons of interactive characters, cool elemental combinations, a variety of enemies and paimon who is just too damn cute. One of the few games that push the boundaries of mobile gaming, I personally loved the game, you can play it at any pace and is beginner friendly.",Positive,363,66
Julian Solano,2020-09-30 09:15:11,"It's an sick game with a huge open world, beautiful graphics, and amazing story line and voice acting. Even though its a big game, it's worth the space. Be prepared though for a couple game glitches to pop, report them to make the game more enjoyable for everyone! However there is this one serious bug that has been ruining my experience. Audio glitch where all sounds go static after a while of just playing the game. Hope it gets fixed soon so I can enjoy the voice acting and music to the fullest",Positive,500,93
Roy boy,2020-10-04 23:54:02,"I don't normally rate games, but I felt an obligation to do so on this game. It is absolutely wonderful. The graphics are beautiful, and the music is even better. At the beginning of the game, you start of with a relatively powerful sword, but as the game develops, you can choose to level the weapon up or swap it out entirely. What I also like is the fact that the story is staggered, and takes a while to complete, rather than it finishing in a day. Brilliant game to play, would highly recommend",Positive,499,94
Rafael Nguyen Alvarez,2020-09-30 10:30:47,"An impactful game in the mobile market with console and PC controls. I like the art style and animation quality that Mihoyo uses in their games like Honkai Impact 3rd which I played for a while now before this. It makes me feel like an adventurer in an anime with great storytelling, voice acting, and backgrounds. I chose to start with the female main character twin and I'm looking forward to seeing where the story goes.",Positive,423,76
Jennifer,2020-10-09 17:59:42,"Amazing, smooth and incredibly enjoyable!! My device is actually a little below the recommended requirement so I was a little worried, but the game runs smoothly. The map is amazing. Open map is 11/10 (bonus point considering it's f2p). There's a lot to do. The characters are cute and unique (and the characters they give you at the start are useful too). Another great game from Mihoyo!!",Positive,389,67
Nads Vintre,2020-09-30 17:27:49,"This is a masterpiece. I can see the love and effort. I was NEVER EVER BORED to play this game and the quests are AMAZING. Thank you for this experience. You deserve all the support. As a f2p player, it's my first time thinking of paying, not for the pulls, but for the devs. Y'all deserve my money, definitely will avail for bundles.",Positive,334,63
J Miyabi,2020-10-05 08:32:01,"Game is great beautiful love the characters, but the only problem here is the more you increase your adventure rank the slower you level up because there's nothing to do at all, and the xp doesn't increase big problem right there. And the summons are okay but getting to primogem is hard they don't give you much for exploring and it cost 1600 just to get 10 intertwined fate to make 10 summons, if they can lower that it would be great but other then that it's a great game.",Positive,475,90
Patrick Guzman,2020-09-29 16:26:05,"Mihoyo's finest game to date. Gameplay is easy to grasp, especially if you've played exploration type games (yeah, that game üòè) Story and lore are very Mihoyo-like, and a screenshot friendly world will make you explore more, not to mention the Easter eggs scattered everywhere. Did encounter some cutscene hiccups. Controls is... Although good, has something to be desired, and that is controller support. It's sad that its only on the pc. (please add it, please)",Positive,463,76
Waleed Shaksheir,2020-09-29 04:11:54,"One of the best open world's on mobile. Graphics are some of the best, combat is really good, characters and quests are cool. Not over the top complex like other rpgs. New characters and monsters are always being introduced, each requiring new tactics to keep it interesting. Developers did a good job with this one. One of the best mobile games I've played in a while",Positive,368,66
QAL 14MI,2020-10-04 13:24:55,"good game, nice graphic, fun experience and exploration, but need more improvement like drops reward and the photo mode need more pose and camera settings, also I'll glad if you let the character can sit wherever we like, not only the one on chair wood or stone, but wherever, and the birthday reward kinda boring tbh, but mostly this game is amazing, cant wait to see other region, cities and other archons, also, will you and mount or something to ride one day?",Positive,463,83
Cecelia Robbins,2020-10-25 04:48:06,"I've only just started but am totally in love! Super fun story and game play, almost comparable to Breath of the Wild.

justin nandana,2020-09-30 20:19:34,"This is a phenomenal game. Graphics are nice, controls are very easy and comfortable to use. Even the gameplay is really easy to understand. The concept of having weaknesses with each element is really classic and I absolutely love it. I'm not a person who is suitable for this kind of fantasy RPG games, but this game is legit way different than other fantasy RPG games I've ever played. And the best feature in this game is probably climbing through everything, even buildings",Positive,478,83
Austin Boyd,2020-10-07 10:45:00,"A very fun game, my only issues are that you can't do certain dungeons or ANY story missions with friends, only domains and two main boss fights are co-op. Team healing food only heal the character you use it on instead of the whole team like it says its supposed to on the description. Also 2 minute cooldowns on resurection items is too long and should cool down while you are still in the inventory. More areas, characters, and maybe characters that use daggers. Characters need power balancing.",Positive,498,88
Steven Yates,2020-10-05 09:23:27,"I just started the game a few days ago, so far the gameplay is amazing!! The voice acting and story is very good, and the combat is addictive!!

Tear note,2020-10-04 05:45:58,"Groundbreaking title unlike anything ever seen on mobile before... This is the AAA RPG we all waited for. Hyperoptimized graphics (just don't expect miracles if your phone is not a flagship,) surprisingly nice music and high quality English VA with Japanese as option. The writing is also top notch and consistently entertaining. Battle system is based on combining elements, which encourages you to switch characters often and makes play very dynamic. Enjoy, and always pet your emergency food.",Positive,495,78
megat ijok,2020-11-11 17:56:00,Can you guys change how the weapons design after ascension add more perks to the weapon like more damage or specialty towards certain enemies. Please consider my post .

Syahirah 'Afifah,2020-09-28 22:15:47,"So far this game is tip top notch with open world concept and I love the fact that you aren't bound with only one character which you can switch avatar in this game. Really looking forward for more interesting output in this game. As far I played the game I just experienced this lag and that things really frustrated but it some how wasn't drag me as to rate 4 stars and below, probably because the game impressed me well. People should give it a try once trust me you gonna love it!",Positive,484,93
Addisyn Krell,2020-09-28 10:46:43,"It's incredible! It has a lot of features found in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild, so it's quite enjoyable. You can explore the world, come across monsters, pick up things like fruit that you find, hunt animals, etc. The graphics are breathtaking as well. And unlike a lot of games similar to this, the dialogue is easy to understand and isnt broken english. Its obvious a ton of effort was put into this game! But, it isnt a game you should be getting if you have a slow device.",Positive,488,92
Grizzly Magnum,2020-10-08 18:59:40,"This could be the best mobile game I have ever tried, has a great storyline, top notch graphics, amazing optimization, and it's not too hard to handle, the gradual unlock of features is a great idea for keeping players engaged, the mechanics are out of this world, the only thing I could complain about was the download speed of the game, had to wait 5 hours cause the speed wouldn't go above a certain number and even failed a couple of times, but nonetheless, it was worth it, wish I could say more",Positive,500,93
Rick Hernandez,2020-10-08 16:36:50,"Great game, extremely free to play friendly. The heroes they give are good enough to get through the game without getting extra pulls if you don't get a hero you want and they give you about 50 free pulls in the early stages of the game. Gameplay and graphics make this a triple A quality game for free. zero complaints other than some QOL adjustments and tweeks",Positive,362,67
Sebbas,2020-10-05 05:36:54,"Esthetically pleasing, very beautiful game, and very breath of the wild/SAO vibes, hands down the best game I've downloaded in my mobile gaming experiences, however do be careful it's a big game that requires a lot of storage and ram so if your phone does not have those capabilities, try to have apps running in the background,but besides that, HAVE FUNüòÅüòÅ",Positive,356,61
Ozzy Smith,2020-10-02 22:54:46,"Easily the best free game you can get. There is a Gacha but it's not required at all. You get a full party for free within the first few hours and that party is extremely well balanced and good. There are also a few more you get for free aswell for farming or clearing certain challenges. There's lots to do if you want to be really hard core, but the quests and daily commissions will get you leveling at a decent rate if you want to be casual aswell. Absolutely give it a shot. It's free.",Positive,490,96
Jr. Slayer,2020-10-01 17:21:14,"Playing this game reminds me when I used to play open world games in consoles, like The legend of Zelda, but with the option of having the game at size of my pocket. For being a game designed for smartphones, the game is extremely beautiful, very addictive, very smooth, although the game needs a lot of space, it doesn't overheat my phone after hours of gameplay. The best part of it, it doesn't feel like a pay-to-win as other rpgs games on the Playstore.",Positive,457,84
Christian Parta,2020-10-10 10:03:10,"This is not a just game. For me, this is an experience. Or you can also say a gaming experience, an absolutely out of this world virtual experience. The world is beautiful and breathtaking and the music enhances that world. The characters are likable enough, and I'm sure we will get to love them as the story progresses and as more of the world is revealed. Battle is unique because of the different elemental reactions. This is the first time I've seen this in a game. Although, ONE THING: Gacha rates. I will gladly pay $100 to get that specific character that I want instead of paying $100 just to get a ""chance"" of getting that 1 character. I know Mihoyo needs money and income, but I'm sure more players will not hesitate to cash in if they know they can get the character they want.",Positive,789,146
Michael Gamboa,2020-10-16 00:59:17,"Honestly it's a miracle this game can even exist on phones. You can tell this was made by devs who care about the user experience. Everything about this is high quality. The music, the graphics, the story, the controls, the UI, the VO, the localization (with a few exceptions), everything comes together to really set a new bar for what games can be on mobile that aren't just ports. Truly astounded. Keep up the work, between this and Honkai, miHoYo is now definitely on my radar.",Positive,481,86
Long Nguyen,2020-09-30 08:04:52,"Really great. Vast open world with few quests and no limitations. The combat system is amazing for a mobile game, so does the elements system. Graphics are amazing, exept it takes too much to load. The stamina system is great in combat, but can be anoying in explorations, but I guess that's part of it to not be able to go some paths. The UI is easy to understand and not overwhelming like some other games. The food system is not so relevant, but great overall.",Positive,463,86
Lucky Seven,2020-10-25 08:28:51,"It's so great, might be the best game I've tried so far, the graphics and the details are just awesome. But for some reasons the game crashed when the loading screen appeared, also the fps is still unstable. Hope the dev can fix that",Positive,233,44
Joshua Gaydon,2020-10-06 22:53:29,"Absolutely enjoy playing this, (edit) There needs to be more interaction when playing co-op most players would like to be able to interact with chest and other things inside another's world otherwise people won't want to play co-op and thats why I continued playing but now its kinda getting boring because the lack of accessibility in a co-op world",Positive,349,59
bella Rod,2020-10-14 07:42:17,"Amazing mechanics and game play!! The storyline are complex and fun, but it is a free roaming world like skyrim where you can collect foods and ore for your character! World bosses around at set levels for you to work your way up to beat! I have really enjoyed this game even though I am so picky. The graphics are beautiful and it's a very enjoyable experience. ( added) game is also not money based so you can work your way up and have a good time w/o pouring cash into this!!!",Positive,479,92
Hardy Dewanto,2020-09-30 15:21:45,"Another masterpiece by Mihoyo and literally one of the best games you can get on the Google Play Store. (Actually you can play it on other platforms as well) Entertaining story, Free-to-play, (mostly) not a Pay-to-Win where your skill matters, and it's a open-world game with a few loading screens. I've been playing since it's release and I am happy to continue doing so for a very long while. Though the game does take a lot to run on your phone. But still, as always, great job Mihoyo!",Positive,488,88
Dave Antoni Dandasan,2020-10-05 04:54:28,"It's phenomenal. The game just leaves me speechless, because of how great it is. I love how you can interact with the terrain. I like how you could do side quests before the main quests are unlocked. The map is huge. It is really awesome. Since I'm playing on my phone, this RPG MMO game, Genshin Impact, is levels beyond other games.",Positive,334,62
Mette Camilla,2020-10-28 02:08:11,The game is great and i love the graphics in it but there are still things that could be done better such as quiding through some missions as i cant get past this one mission because it doesnt show me where the location is supposted to be or which way to look for it.,Positive,267,54
Stefanos Michael,2020-10-20 17:17:30,"I can't believe u made a port on the phone for this game, it's amazing, thank you! Try and give us the options to change the graphics settings for more optimization and increase in fps, also lock fps option would be best as many people don't carry latest technology smartphones. :)",Positive,281,51
Orry Gobin,2020-10-01 07:35:42,"Surprisingly good. The cross play is a huge feature and allows me to pass the time when I'm out (which is admittedly not much nowadays). It is a Gatcha game, but the perks of having better units or weapons seem secondary to the progression system, in which you have lots of chances for getting decent loot (Usually 3* or below, but it's free). The 5* characters are better than others, but not oppressively so. Overall, you could easily play this without spending a penny, like I have thus far.",Positive,494,89
Jamee Powell,2020-10-05 01:24:20,"An amazing RPG with strong leanings towards Breath of the Wild. Amazing graphics, beautiful sounds and musical score, excellent voiceover work, in depth leveling and evolving system. Fun and intriguing quest system with world events. An inspiring RPG that anyone can enjoy, and diehard adventurers will cherish. See you in the Adventurer's Guild, Outlander.",Positive,357,54
Carson Julvezan,2020-10-21 12:26:27,"A triple A game for free This game is a full fledged adventure rpg with a story, soundtrack, beautiful world, and characters; all for free. Also, if you have a capable PC I'd recommend getting that version. The experience is much better.",Positive,237,42
Bored Bean Burrito,2020-09-30 04:29:18,"Genshin Impact is what all mobile game developers should be looking up to. There is no deny that the game looks like it was inspired by BoTW and that's a plus in my book. The world is immersive with tons of explorables and side quest that kept me glued to the screen for the past 2 days. The main characters fall to a somewhat ""stereo-typical anime"" clich√© but all the side quests are the real bread and butter. The game is a bit taxing on your phone but overall, I had a good time.",Positive,482,94
DICEBlOCK,2020-10-04 02:17:07,"I got a mountable/portable fan for my device, because the graphics are so freaking good that my huawei p20pro is now my #1 source of heat for the next winter! Shows how much I like the game ;). This is the first mobile game (in my opinion) that is worth your time. Have you ever played a game where you could play it on your pc in 4K then decided to bring it in your pocket ? Well with this, you can do. Oh ,and also, ANIME",Positive,423,87
daniel thompson,2020-10-01 05:58:00,"So far the best RPG on Any console. I've had few issues with video cutscenes lagging, and stopping. The controls are simple and easy to understand I wish I could increase the size because on small phone my fingers hit 2 buttons the same time. The game is very viberate in colors, the dialogue is very nice I like to listen and not have to read everything making this my new favorite game so far. Character designs are amazing like noelle, cant wait to see the Rest",Positive,464,87
Valentine M,2020-10-12 21:42:47,Kinda stunned by the quality so far. Never expected this game to be this good. Still need to get used to different elements and how to combine them but thats what ups the skill ceiling. The game has a bit of P2W where you can use cash to open multiple packages and get stronger heroes and weapons quicker but the difference is seriously negligible so far. You are awarded with enough points to open a few packages yourself and there is nothing stopping you from enjoying as free 2 play,Positive,485,90
Lucky -Michaela W.,2020-09-30 06:15:10,"Beautiful graphics and amazing story. I am upset that you can't customize the characters, however they do took amazing the way they are so idk if I would even change a thing XD Kaeya is awesome and my favorite by far. I really would like to see an ability to romance some of the main characters with the mc. Not sure how it would work but if there was like a special quest or something to romance them and it unlocks a couple of duologues in the main story if they have completed one of the quests.",Positive,498,97
vape spawn,2020-10-02 11:28:05,"Where to begin? This game blew my mind. I've spent over 35hours in game now and I'm still busy discovering new quests, secrets, and upgrades to my characters. I've played gacha games for over 3 years now. Yes, including 'that one'. The mechanics are similar but the execution in Genshin is down right impressive. The attention to detail and the creativity blows every other mobile game out of the water. 10/10 will be playing this one for a while now doubt. Highly recommend giving it a go.",Positive,490,87
Fascade Gz,2020-09-30 16:24:11,"Highly polished game. Tons of fun and joy in adventure. Amazing detail in world building and lore. Breathtaking graphic and beautiful scenery. Not to mention the beautiful sound and music. Last but not least, a wonderful gaming experience with interesting cast of characters. Well done and good job to devs!",Positive,307,50
Nick Thayer,2020-10-06 02:45:14,"Out of every F2P games I've played and mobile games I've played, this is the first game I really felt like I should leave a review for. The graphics are stunning. Gameplay is fluid and fun. Stories and world is just breathtaking. Truly a 10/10 masterpiece of a game. Only thing I have to add that could further improve this game are more methods of movement. Maybe mounts or flying mounts! Just a thought.",Positive,405,74
Hussein AL-Tai,2020-10-17 11:28:01,"The game is very beautiful and very fun, the graphics are fantastic. I played the game before on the PS4, and now I tried it on the phone. The graphics accuracy on the phone impressed me. It is even stronger than the PS4. I highly recommend you try it. But the thing that bothered me was the inability to continue playing on the phone with the same playstation account because I had progressed a lot in the PS and reached the rank22. I dont think that this may bother many people.",Positive,480,91
Turkeydipking,2020-09-29 17:50:58,"A new standard for mobile games! Ridiculously impressed with the scope and execution of this game. Runs like a dream on my OnePlus 7 Pro and barely eats up any battery! The gameplay is fluid, combat is fun, and exploration is rewarding. Monetization seems fair and doesn't get constantly advertised to you. I'm 4ish hours in and still unlocking new systems and mechanics! This truly is a Breath of the Wild style open world action RPG which you can just carry in your pocket. Incredible work",Positive,491,86
Gene Macgregor,2020-10-12 10:30:55,"One of the best games I have played in a long time. I have already spent around 50hrs playing and i love my team. There is micro transactions, but they don't break the game. So still fun without spending. Has a wide variety of characters that each play completely differently and elemental reactions which i found neat. Looking forward to the expansions when they come.",Positive,369,65
Legin Wheulfic,2020-10-23 17:46:17,"Excellent game which has great music and story. Also it does not require me to grind like like crazy everyday, just log in and spend about 30 mins to get the the most important daily rewards. Perfect for somebody who works and doesn't have time to grind hours per day",Positive,267,50
Bo Ming Xu,2020-10-02 21:48:48,"This is a real console quality game experience on mobile. I'd recommend to play on PC, you can link your mobile account and pick up right where you left off. Gatcha can be a deep money sink, play at your own risk. You still need the app if you want to spend money, I think if you created your account with Google play",Positive,317,63
Katheryn Lee,2020-09-29 10:10:46,"One of the best games I have ever enjoyed. Only problem is it did not play well on my phone due to how big it is. But very enjoyable when play it in pc. The best is it is cross platform and can play anywhere wether pc, mobile or consoles. Gacha is also good and f2p friendly. It is also worth your money when you spend to grind your characters up and deserve it since its free to play. You can enjoy the world freely and always love the graphics and atmosphere of the game. A must have game!!!",Positive,493,99
EGGBROOO g,2020-10-06 14:54:44,"The game is really beautiful and fun and I find it as the best free and beautiful multiplatform game, but my only problem is the constant crashes, and fps spikes. I understand that the game is huge because of the big world and graphics but as a mobile player it's hard to play when I constantly crash. But overall the game is perfect. Keep up the good worküëå.",Positive,358,68
Wyatt Melendrez,2020-10-14 05:12:36,"This is such an amazing game! I was expecting a Legend of Zelda: BOTW clone, but it has surpassed my expectations, able to be on the same level with that amazing game without completely copying it. Truly wonderful graphics especially for a mobile game, and an amazing plot so far, one to surpass BOTWs, in my opinion. My only complaint is that, like in any other mobile game, the joystick will often mess me up. This is only a small issue, and a common one at that. Epic game though.",Positive,483,90
Ashley Banta,2020-09-29 02:29:06,"I just started today after registering to play with the game releasing from beta. I've had tons of fun so far, and I really like the open-world aspect of the game. The graphics and sound design from what I've witnessed so far are phenomenal. The game uses team customization like Final Fantasy or RAID where each character has their own strengths, but you only have one active character at a time. Controls are pretty standard for mobile, and thoughtfully laid out which I appreciate.",Positive,484,84
SUSHI SENPAI,2020-09-29 05:49:41,"Its like, I'm playing in PC. Voice Acting is superb, the environment is beautiful, story-line is great not like other rpg games out there, and also the action is awesome, I'm loving every second of this game, I hope this game won't be the P2W type of game, that would ruin the experience.",Positive,288,53
Emma Weaver,2020-10-05 05:36:58,The game itself is beautiful. The graphics are bright and clear. The soundtrack is calming and not overwhelming. The story is engaging and has not gotten boring or tedious. The controls are a little tricky at first especially if this is your first time playing this type of game. Overall a great game and I am looking forward to what comes next.,Positive,345,62
say aceceh,2020-10-08 05:24:27,"A very outstanding game. Its like assassin creed with a twist of 4 characters that can do combo. The combo part is the most attractive for me. Overall fun and relax game. Only slight downside for me, even with smartphone huawei p20, the flow is a bit sluggish, i need to put the lowest setting for the game to be a bit smooth to play. Will be playing this game for a long time. Thumbs up. Keep up the great work guys.",Positive,417,82
Shadow Alex,2020-10-14 00:37:50,"I'm giving it 5 stars, the game is amazing and has good mechanics, although there are some ups and downs, I enjoy it alot, I'd like the climbing mechanics to be reworked Abit due to how annoying it is to climb, also once you reach lvl 30 there's restrictions on how much you can do, by that I mean it gets extremely grindy, and really drains the excitement from the game, story also becomes dry in the middlish lvls",Positive,415,79
A T,2020-10-14 20:30:26,"Best Crossplay RPG. Did not expect much but was blown away. Grapbics, gameplay and story is on top. Characters are very charminv and gameplay extremly smooth. Its crossplay so you can play with friends who play pc, ps or mobile (ps account not usable on others though). The only thing that needs to be mentioned: -coop mode. Not much you can do with friends as quests and chests are locked as same as dungeons. -gacha rates are (still) horrid and will take tons of money if you aim for certain chara",Positive,499,91
Rin Tadashi,2020-09-29 14:50:46,"The game and gameplay is really cool, the game is really responsive and lag free, the only problem I found is that some open world noises are not properly mastered and they give out and awful sound. Other than that, good job. Edit: I tried out the game on PC and it works flawlessly, the only minor thing I noticed and would be happy to see is to allow key binding changes on the PC version. Some of the controls are not user friendly. Also the phone I use to play is Samsung Galaxy S10.",Positive,487,95
Jai Large,2020-10-05 21:00:42,"You've actually created one of the best games I have ever played thank you. Controls are decent , Gameplay is solid, Graphics are phenomenal, Character design brilliant , Never a dull moment whist playing, So much to do for a free game and no adds which is amazing, Gatcha system in place but is never forced and isn't pay to win, Now just waiting for the switch version which will hopefully have cross save so I can transfer my save from my phone to the switch. Great jobs guys thank you :)",Positive,491,92
The windmill,2020-10-04 20:31:25,"It's was a [Fun and Thrilling game with alot of questions in the air. It has Stunning graphics and Good animation with the Great voice acting and a Good story plot with Good controls.] It's a Open world game with Many Secrets and has [tons of Enemy, Bosses and Secret Chest just to be found.] It gave me a Minecraft and a Breath of the wild vibes. I had no problem with the game but only some internet issues. Other than that it's [a Awesome game and I think everyone should play this Fabulous game.]",Positive,500,95
Andrew Truong,2020-09-30 11:05:45,"Genshin Impact is an amazing game from a Chinese company that specializes in mobile games. I am honestly blown away by how much effort that has been put into the game. Pretty good graphics, a clean UI, and pretty good voice acting (I recommend to select the Japanese voice actors). Overall, if they continue to support the game well, this game would be a solid game for years to last.",Positive,384,70
Joshua Gundersen,2020-10-07 23:44:15,"I actually really like this game and I can't say that for a lot of mobile games in general, let alone RPGs, but this is a LEGIT open world game. True they may cash in on a few aspects, but the voice acting, combat, cooking, and even world exploring have distinct differences (for all those hating on it for being too much like BotW) I say shut up and actually give the game a chance.",Positive,383,75
Blue Blaze,2020-10-24 16:39:43,"The game is great it works fine at 20 fps but yesterday i installed a new software update the game still works fine but the sound is stuttering too much that never happened before,i‚Ä≤m not sure if you are the ones who can fix this or not but please if you can fix it then fix it",Positive,277,57
Kuzugu,2020-10-09 13:45:14,Didn't expect this game to be as exciting and interesting as it is. You will explore the map and then still always find these cute little areas and villages hidden away. The gameplay is engaging and quickly pulls you in. All in all its a wonderful game with depth and story that I didnt expect to find in a mobile game lol.,Positive,323,62
Bri,2020-10-07 01:26:27,Free to Play forward! I don't pay into mobile games and was excited to find that this isn't a Pay to Win game. It encourages exploration and rewards you greatly. The puzzles and bosses range from basic to the intricate. The score is breathtaking. How is this game free? I am dumbfounded that this game was free and isn't bogged down by greediness or advertisements. You actually have to seek it out instead of it being shoved into your face! It's a true open world!,Positive,465,85
Luis flores,2020-09-28 10:48:43,"Been playing for an hour, and the game is awesome. The mechanics are interesting and fun, the voices of the characters sound awesome, and I love them.

As expected of miHoYo, the game is impeccable and excellent.",Positive,392,71
Matt D,2020-10-16 09:33:59,"Finally! A game to take mobile gaming to the next level. One of the best RPGs I've ever played. it's a PS4 experience on the phone. Hopefully other brands like Harry Potter follow suit and realize that this is what mobile games should and can be. An nhl mobile game doesn't even exist yet, but genshin impact just advanced mobile gaming into a new stratosphere. Time for other games to keep up.",Positive,394,72
Nick Lorenzo,2020-10-11 00:34:48,"Amazing and beautiful game, very smooth with lots of stuff to do. My only suggestion would be to have a way to customize controls for mobile, such as moving the joystick location or have a joystick active where you press. Other than that I can't wait for more content!! Thank you for the great game!!",Positive,300,55
One,2020-10-09 00:24:21,"Everything is amazing. I love the graphics, the gameplay is run and intuitive, and the controls are simple and easy to learn. The only problem I have with the game is that I wish it had a auto-pickup feature as having to stand near a dropped item for 2 seconds is kind of tedious, nonetheless great game. (This feature is mostly meant for the mobile version as rh3 PC version is fine as is)",Positive,390,74
Henchelle Rae Omecillo,2020-10-31 23:40:58,"Great game with good graphics (even at lowest) and nice anime characters with a very free open world setting where you can even climb mountains,swim oceans, or KILL CRITTERS which is arguably the best part! Though I suggest to allow 4-star characters to evolve into 5-star characters.",Positive,284,47
neil kundert,2020-10-04 04:46:35,"This game is absolutely marvelous. It is stunning visually even on mobile, and is way better than most RPGs that cost lots money. They are very generous with new players, giving them free pulls. Getting good characters isn't even necessary since they provide you with many different types of characters in game, but it is definitely worth spending lots of money on. Story wise the game is very entertaining, with many interesting sob plots going on while you play through the main story.",Positive,487,83
Vlad,2020-10-08 06:03:43,"Graphics are just fantastic!! Controls are comfortable, but i ,sometimes, have difficulties with climbing. Gameplay also very good, exploring open world I find pretty generic for this type of game, BUT elemental interaction is the key and fundamental feature of exploring and combat. To sum it up, this game is brilliant!!!!!",Positive,325,51
MJ,2020-10-11 18:30:53,"One of the best mobile games I've played ever. It is quite taxing on my S10 though. I play on medium to high settings at 60 fps. It's such an eye candy. Story is okay, voice acting is quite surprisingly good minus a few errors when pertaining to the main character. Huge map that ain't bland and boring at a. I don't mind the gacha system because I feel that it's fair enough and my 4 star heroes are sufficient at least in the 25 hours I've spent in-game. Just try it guys.",Positive,474,93
Not Fair,2020-10-03 12:45:00,"Good game, I loved breath of the wild and this is amazing. Highly recommend, love the elements and their interactions, it's not a clone, it's just inspired. Gacha is a necessary evil, but it is a free game and I think it's pretty good, and you get a good amount of free characters without gacha.",Positive,295,55
Raizer Night,2020-09-30 23:57:39,"The game is not only beautiful but comprehensive as well. With various characters, weapons, and elements, the battles in the game are very fun. I love how the elements of the characters can affect the environment and will create different results depending on said element. The open world is also vast and there is plenty of content to enjoy. This game definitely gets a 5/5.",Positive,375,65
Ech√∏,2020-09-27 11:44:46,"I played the last closed beta of this game, and I have to say it's the best open world RPG I have ever played. The world is BEAUTIFUL, characters are interesting and fun to play with, and the variety of them ensures that you can create the ideal team for you. The gacha system is also very f2p friendly, just like their other game Honkai Impact 3rd, which I also play. Overall a very entertaining experience that I would highly recommend to anyone interested. Can't wait for the official launch!!",Positive,496,90
TKGaming Origins,2020-10-01 07:21:16,"Great game which is also pretty accessible, however be aware if using older hardware, even a snapdragon 855 can lag (personally i use max settings), the controls are decent, but using the bow is kind of hard due to the frame drops and being touch based (havent tried gyroscopic option). Being able to cross save with my pc is a huge plus, meaning i can play at home on pc, and on mobile when more convenient. A game i recommend.",Positive,428,80
jack jonhson,2020-10-03 14:24:40,"Even if this game was only half as good as it is it would still be amazing, especially for a free game. The graphics are amazing, and I love the similarities it has to BOTW. I really like the base mechanics of the game. As I said it's got intense botw vibes while still feeling like a completely different game. I wouldn't mind playing another game exactly like this with a different story or setting. Also I love the jokes. Paimon isn't emergency food!",Positive,453,84
Geordan Johnson,2020-10-04 10:00:10,"For a free to play, cross platform mobile game, this really goes above and beyond anything else out there in terms of playable content. The controls are a bit unresponsive sometimes, but for a new release it's such high quality that any complaints I have are dwarfed in the sheer amount to do and play. From the engaging dialogue to the unique gameplay, there's a lot going for this game. I hope it stays around for years to come.",Positive,430,79
Ian Gatchalian,2020-09-28 18:54:22,"First, it's cross platformed. It has a great way in letting people play with eachother because of the adaptability of it being able to support other devices. The graphics are really great and so was the gameplay. I like the storyline and voice acting . It has many different playstyles you can do not just hunting down enemies so people can choose what they want to do. Lastly, I really like how it's open world. Even though the mob difficulty spikes, but just roaming around and exploring is great.",Positive,499,89
Jairo Zamora,2020-09-30 04:08:58,"Game is beautiful but that is a given seeing as Honkai Impact 3rd was also beautiful. The combat mechanics are enjoyable, the way the elements interact is top notch. Its a shame you guys aren't releasing the game on Xbox though, my wife plays on Xbox and would enjoy this game very much but other than that. I am very much enjoying the game, everything about it is top notch.",Positive,375,70
Ancy Poulose,2020-10-08 02:29:47,"It is definetely one of THE most fun games I have ever played!

Would also like to request console controller compatibility...I tried it since I have sweaty hands, I hope in future updates the devs would consider it.",Positive,342,61
Soli,2020-10-04 12:57:28,This game is an amazing open world experience. The soundtracks gives me shivers as I go through the story. It feels like an anime and a game at the same time with cutscenes during quest. The game runs really well when setting resolution to 0.8 and the graphics are still awesome on all low. Voice acting is also done well but sometimes not lipsynced. I would 100% recommend this to anyone that likes Breath of the Wild as it is basically that but combined with anime!,Positive,467,86
Jay Min,2020-10-21 15:51:19,"The best graphic I had seen on mobile, the fighting is good, the storyline is alright. The only drawback is this game time consuming and pricy to get to the top player. But I am a casual player, I am having fun by just walk around the map.",Positive,239,48
Offensive Dream,2020-10-03 10:37:40,"Well for starters I pre registered this game with high expectations and by God they exceeded everything I expected! A free open world game with no pay to play is something that i respect as many other games fall short on and the graphics are top tier, I'd go as far to say that they're one of a kind. Leveling in the game is balanced and everyday you get commissions to help level you up. So all in all... good game üëå",Positive,417,82
Shamanth,2020-10-26 20:11:11,It is a really great game with huge amounts of potential. I have played like 2 weeks and I am already addicted to it. My only problem with this game is it is really hard to get a good character without using any money. Don't turn this into a pay to win please..,Positive,261,53
JANOS,2020-09-29 12:25:25,"Big issue, sometimes for no reason frames drop to zero. I can go just in middle on nowhere and suddenly freeze. I looked at battery settings and game should work normally but it don't. On PC I love it, here, I hate that freezing. I can run game on max graphics no problem, but sometimes it's just goes to zero even on lowest settings.",Positive,334,64
Chengsue Yang,2020-10-11 13:41:55,"You might spend some money this is a gacha style game but ive had a lot of fun grinding so far, unfortunately I've heard multi-player is lacking. The story is interesting the graphics are great, load times are barely there. Dungeons seem a bit simple so far though but if the next update makes it even 10% of the world map were in for a great ride.",Positive,348,67
Death Beard,2020-10-05 23:22:00,"Its a really nice game, from the start i adored the environment, i was thinking to give it 4 star so you maybe see my comment, but you made an awesome game and it deserves 5 star, what made me think of giving 4 stars is swimming, its a bit stupid if you run out of stamina to drown and die, thats the only thing i saw needs a change so far, but everything else is nice",Positive,368,77
Spirit Comics,2020-09-29 07:42:12,The graphics are beautiful! I would feel better controlling the character if I had an actual controller than just tap the screen. The gameplay is nice but the tutorial was WAY TO BRIEF. It's really difficult to figure out where to go and for what. The sprite or fairy was no help. She just flew away. I had NO IDEA where I was supposed to go. My character fell and lost a lot of hit points. I don't know how to find the places to replenish my HP. IN-GAME-INSTRUSTION is needed.,Positive,477,91
DFX77,2020-10-01 12:12:11,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING! LOVING IT!! The character design is very good, gameplay is easy to understand. Just the problem is that it's pretty poorly optimised at the time of reviewing this, barely able to reach 25 fps on any settings here on Samsung Galaxy S10, and the cutscene lagged too sometimes. Improve that and it'll be AWESOME!",Positive,331,58
Dave Brown,2020-10-08 21:51:16,"Quite possibly the best game I have played on my phone, I cant get enough! Graphic are spectacular, gameplay while a little confusing to start is easy to adapt to, the controls could be a little better and a button to climb instead of auto climbing and randomly climbing trees in combat would be nice. Also an option to auto pick up would be nice too gets a little tedious, would also like to be able to switch server as the recommended has high latency great game highly reccomended.",Positive,484,89
Ryan Sommerville,2020-10-10 06:48:49,"It's Breath of the Wild for mobile. Yes, thats an exaggeration, barely tho. For those complaining about the drop rates..it's a pebble in the ocean as far as I'm concerned. The amount of time and effort that has obviously been put into this game is very clear. Very fun for anyone who loves a big beautiful open world where you can run, climb, swim, slice, pound, craft, upgrade..just so much everything. It's great, completely free. Wanna be #1, spend some money. Or enjoy it all the same for free",Positive,497,89
J Rod,2020-10-02 04:16:41,"Literally dont know if I'll ever be able to touch another mobile game ever. This game crushes every other mobile game, genre, everything. The production quality is absolutely perfect. Open world, no pay wall, no stamina wall, tons of different character strategies and playstyles. It's just awesome, and an absolute joy to play.",Positive,328,53
CJ JC,2020-10-27 04:32:31,"First time i found a good rpg that didn't auto run/ auto quest. This one didn't rip the soul out of the game with auto-play, it's pretty good so far, but I havnt played much yet. Really looking forward to more free time to start playing it more!",Positive,245,48
Trinh2 Limit,2020-10-03 02:05:39,"First off this game is amazing. Excellent job on gameplay , controls , graphics everything. The story is very well written and enemies are evenly balanced. If you compare the gameplay to Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild it has similar statistics but it's different and not an exact copy of the game. However if you can add a crouch button to the game (we could possibly sneak up on enemies to attack them) this could make it so enemies don't see you 2 feet before you attack them. Thank you!",Positive,494,92
Emily Sheffield,2020-09-30 20:14:09,"I would say this is the BEST open world game I have ever played. Everything is on point! The graphics look exactly like the trailers, the voice overs for the characters, and my favorite feature is that it saves your progress cross platform! I switched to my PC and it went back to where I left off. It does take a while to download, which is understandable because of the graphics, the world, and individual items, but other than that this is my FAVORITE game ever! Please please please, try this out",Positive,500,92
Rainder,2020-10-11 13:23:19,"This is the best mobile game I've ever seen in my life, no joke! The story, the map, and there is so many details!! You can literally run around the map as you wish, like BOTW, Its like a triple A title all for the price of 0 dollars. Absolutely reccomend it for people looking for a nice time waster.",Positive,301,60
Yog hmoob,2020-09-29 20:44:37,"This game is amazing on pc. Playing on a 2k monitor is amazing and beautiful. Love the graphics its so clean and sharp. Down side is that the Android version is kinda bad in my opinion, graphics not as good as the pc, low fps and harder to move around but can't expect much from an phone due to phones having much weaker hardware than pc. I use a flag ship phone to play this, note 20 ultra. (If u have a high end pc i highly recommend playing this on the pc, 2k 4k is amazing)",Positive,477,97
JunÂ≠ê,2020-10-04 08:27:49,"The game graphics, musical ambient and everything about it is so beautifully made, I love it. Regarding a few performance problems, it's understandable that it needs quite a lot of resources to be played, but maybe a quick optimization on the cinematics for low and medium end devices? Since in some of these we can't see the cinematics due to the amount of resources it takes to run them, so the scenes are stuck most of the times, only leaving text and a bit of a laggy audio.",Positive,478,88
Raynaldo Setyadi,2020-10-04 08:14:55,"I'm writing this review based mostly based on my gameplay on PC. Without a doubt thia game looks marvelous even in mobile, the open world and the exploreable areas are packed with puzzles that you can solve it really feels like a great single player game even though it has co-op 95% od your gameplay is mostly single player only, the controls are fine but it would be great if you can rebind them. I wish there was a ""potato"" graphic settings in mobile so lower spec phones can run it more smoothly.",Positive,500,93
Rayzer Maniac,2020-09-30 01:20:06,"This may be the most beautiful game ever created for the mobile platform. Right off the bat you can see how vibrant and colourful the vast open world is. Combat feels great, realistic and dynamic. You feel like your fighting real tangible opponents not spamming attacks almost into thin air like say in LOTRO. Characters are fully voiced. The only drawback so far is the game is very performance heavy. You need a powerful device to play. I highly recommend this game to everyone.",Positive,480,84
Alex Vazquez,2020-10-13 00:16:12,"Love this game. The story is great, the side missions entertaining. They've been very receptive about feedback. Oh and the graphics are top notch. Love the colors and crisp quality. My only issue is the controls in some scenarios like in between rocks or next to a wall.. characters get stuck or focus on the wrong way and I end up wasting a skill.",Positive,348,64
Izak J,2020-10-03 18:19:09,"This game is mind-blowingly good, the fact you got this to work on mobile is even bigger, the gameplay is extremely fun and the developers really put in the effort for the scenery etc, The game is around 8gb but it's worth every bit of it. You're also able to change the graphics settings for your device If possible, please make a 120/144hz fps as I'm on the s20 ultra and it'd be nice to see Also please keep optimising the game, Thanks so much for making such a wonderful game",Positive,479,91
Nexlord17,2020-10-04 12:44:28,"This game is by far the best game I've played in a long while. It reminds me of breath of the wild, and the anime aesthetic is very pleasing. Gameplay is smooth and seamless, while mobile controls could use a remapping option. I love being able to play with friends on other consoles as well. I feel the ps4 exclusive sword is a little over powered, but other then that i love this game, looking forward to making content on the channel for this game.",Positive,451,85
Steven Christian,2020-10-05 21:58:56,"The combat is fast and fluid and handles multiple enemies better than The Witcher 3 or Dark Souls. Your character simply attacks the nearest enemy and you're free to move around the battlefield. The graphics are gorgeous, there is freedom of exploration and so many things to find. There are many little puzzles and challenges dotted around. This game is a masterpiece and it's free. I've been playing until 2am every night on PC and haven't spent a cent.",Positive,455,79
FireFew 7797,2020-10-24 23:51:36,1 thing i dont like i that you dont get to pick your 2nd caricature but other then that this game is the s**t like this game is so fun when you first install it it takes a year but when its finished its freaking awesome so worth playing i recommend 100% and its not hard to play ok just a little bit but this game is my all time favorite!!,Positive,339,71
stephen metcalfe,2020-09-29 12:02:30,"The game is super fun and I feel that a lot of the non 5 star reviews are people finding something to complain about. A mobile game will never be perfect, but this game is the closest I have seen. Micro-transactions aren't in your face the whole time like other free games and the free parts are super fun and engaging",Positive,318,61
Westies are besties,2020-10-12 00:58:14,"I love the game so much. The graphics are beautiful, the music is amazing, the story is fun, and I like the characterization. My one complaint, is that in the English version of the game, there were a few times when my female character was referred to as the brother. For example in certain dialogue the characters would refer to her as he, mention her missing sister when it should have been her brother, etc. Just small stuff. Anyway, I love this game very much.",Positive,464,85
Hanh Saji Arre,2020-10-03 21:41:35,"Graphics is great. Gamplay is exceptional. Sound , voicing and music are also outstanding. All thanks to the hard work of the devs! Got a suggestio though. Dunno if this would make sense, but devs can add a mount system like horses or various other mounts for traveling without using the portal. Really really great game! Thanks!",Positive,329,57
Manny Montijo,2020-10-03 20:15:02,"The game is insanely fun, beautiful, and well thought out has far has game mechanics go. Only gripe at the moment is the gender mix up in game. I don't know if this is an issue for the brother, but i chose the sister and for the gender specific dialog. Words that refer to the gender of the siblings such as his, her, male, girl and the like, are constantly getting mixed up. It makes it obvious which sibling you were suppose to pick and it drives me insane. I realy hope it gets fixed soon.",Positive,492,96
Mitsuki Maigo,2020-09-28 18:32:53,"An amazing open world game with unlimited potential. Granted... I should never be given an open world game as the moment it told me I could jump I immediately climbed the nearest wall into a ""high risk area""! I wasn't even told how to fight yet! It's a good thing the game doesn't let you climb to the top of the mountain side to said high risk area. Piemon is going to hate me!",Positive,378,74
m v,2020-10-04 10:53:57,"This is a great game. Looks good, gameplay just feels right. Admittedly co-op unlock is taking forever, but hopefully this means more people playing actually know what's going on. Also, I've gotten one five star character and the rest have been only four star characters and I haven't paid for any draws. So the drop rate seems to have been improved.",Positive,350,61
Ratnakar Maller,2020-10-07 13:30:37,"Great Game. Love the visuals and story. The game itself is the work of a mastermind. I have only one issue, the server connectivity. Network speeds are slow even with strong connectivity in my area. I also had issues with the story. It hangs up( the frame freezes) while narrating the story. I hope you get rid of this error in future updates. Please help me if possible.I found the missions really interesting, the story is very endearing. Thank you Mihoyo for such a masterpiece.",Positive,481,85
aaron oates,2020-09-30 13:55:41,"Extremely fun and engaging story lines, the characters and gear look fantastic and the game plays very smoothly making combat and exploring feel fluid. The only thing I have a problem with is that I play on PS4 AND mobile and leaning towards dropping mobile because of no controller support, I'm on Note 10+ playing using a touch screen is very frustrating most of the time. This is a shame because PS4 will miss out on events and promos that the other version won't like the recent ""road"" event.",Positive,496,89
Riza Mae,2020-10-08 15:12:08,"I love RPGs, open-world games, and anime, and this game is a great combination of those genres! I've never played a gacha game before this one, so this was my introduction to that type of game, and I love it. I hope getting rolls will be easier in the future, as I haven't been getting much good rolls, but overall this game is incredibly enjoyable. I didn't expect it to play so well on my phone but the controls are honestly easier then when I played on the PS4 (if a bit more cramped)!",Positive,488,94
Bryan Valmonte,2020-10-09 21:37:36,"I want to start by saying that this game is one of the best free to play games of all time. Heck, it even surpasses premium games of the looter rpg genre. Combat is complex and actually engaging, this is especially true when you face elite BOSSES. The graphics will take your breath away on PC AND on mobile. The characters have surprisingly witty dialogue and the world feels alive. NPCs have their own lives and stories. I'm running out of words, but overall the game is a true JRPG Masterpiece.",Positive,497,91
Flocks Skrooner,2020-10-03 08:11:14,"Great game. Actually fun and a large open world. Isn't like those other open worlds where it autoplays for you. Just one thing that really annoys me. In the beginning, you are given a choice between a brother or sister, I chose the sister but the characters in the game talks to me as if my character is a boy.",Positive,310,60
Jiggly Fluff,2020-10-11 21:31:01,"Im actually impressed with this game. Often enough I leave reviews for rewards, but I genuinly am here to say; wow! Its almost like playing Breath of the Wild on your phone. The characters are all very well done, with a lot of voiceovers that bring out the characters personalities. The gameplay is great too, and I'm excited to get to Adventure Rank 16 so I can coop with some friends. Highly recommended!",Positive,406,73
Shawn Michael A. Dayuday,2020-10-13 17:23:32,"For a mobile game, it's sooo astonishing, I love the style and everything in this game, the details and mechanics. It would be cool if you can develop the game more in terms of compatibility, I have friends that loves the game but because of the compatibility issue, they have to wait a little, I wish you can develop this issue fast, Thanks!",Positive,342,63
Baraku Twisted,2020-09-28 23:21:43,"The game is alot of fun, the graphics are amazing and the story actually interested. Ive played alot of mmos and for some reason I just really listen to the story here. The combat is great where its not too complicated for a hardcore mmo player but advanced enough to always keep your attention. Graphically they chose a timeless art style that looks great on mobile and amazing on pc. Now to the $ they seem generous with giving the premium currency for doing just about anything. Its a good game",Positive,497,91
Dave Smith,2020-10-07 15:32:43,This game is fantastic. The fact you can pick up where you left off on pc or console right on your phone is amazing. Hopefully they add controller support for Android soon. I can see myself sinking lots of hours into this game. (And money). Don't let the gacha aspect turn you off either. You get free characters just for doing the story quests and you'll have plenty of opportunities to earn the in game currency used to summon new characters and weapons.,Positive,456,83
kakumoro,2020-10-02 17:15:44,"Possibly one of the best game i've ever come across. At first i was skeptical, thinking this would be another PTW game that pretends to be generous at first, but i was wrong. Sure there's an option to buy in-game currency (used to 'wish' for heroes or weapons), but you can also get the currency by doing quests and explore the map. There's strategy in battle, so even if you have low-tier heroes, you can still win if you use the right elemental reaction. The co-op makes it even more awesome!",Positive,494,91
Billy Crow,2020-10-03 05:54:21,"Great game! I normaly play on pc because my phone is not that great. The pros to this game are great visuals, elemental combat is interesting, and the map is full of exploration to find quest and different loot . The cons are 5 star charactors are very rare to get, and there are varies waiting times for different things in game but that is not to bad. Its a free game full of stuff to do.",Positive,390,77
Apple Tangerine,2020-10-27 10:45:15,"As a fan of Mihoyo games, as well as Breath of the Wild, I am throughly enjoying this. Gatcha rates could be better, perhaps, but gameplay wise I really like it. It's better control wise on a console or PC, but the mobile works just fine, just some adjustments.",Positive,261,49
Tyler Maruschak,2020-10-13 23:32:43,"I'll be the first to admit that I was highly skeptical of this game as an avid JRPG player(free to play, mobile, etc). I started it up and I was blown away by how good it is. It is addicting and I never feel pressured to spend money to play. Amazing in every way and worth your time for a good story and great gameplay. Love playing it on my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra!",Positive,363,74
Ibthisham Mohamed,2020-10-02 03:19:52,"This is the mobile dream rpg and what I was looking for years. Great story, Open world which u can grind and explore freely with no boring auto play, Amazing Graphics & Character designs, unique characters with voice, skills and magic which have different strengths and weaknesses against different types of enemies and magic even interacts with world around u, and screen is not full of texts like other RPGs on mobile. The Devs have put so much love on this game u can feel it. Highly recommend !",Positive,498,89
ÏßÑÍ≤ΩÏ§Ä,2020-10-07 06:13:38,"I underestimated this game (since i used to play on the phone) Once i restarted on the PC port things were so smooth and i did note graphic wise it is very Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild as many people have said but the gameplay wise it feels more like hmm let say this simply. It is Free to Play Breath of the Wild with gameplay similar to soul workers in combat, walls and cliff climbing mechanic from Theif, glide and float from mario odessy, and the base character design inspired heavily from their Honkai Impact 3rd series. For a free game it has tons of depths, tons of story it feels like time and effort has been put into this game even though it was going to be a free to play. For that MiHoYo you get 5 stars.",Positive,724,142
Questionable Drag,2020-10-16 12:34:54,"I'm loving how the game allows you to progress without using a basic phone game stamina system, instead your stamina is used for moving around lol. Though there is a problem later in the game with leveling up and (Ressin) I think that for a free game it's in a class all its own. Good job MiHoYo hope you give us Travellers some great content in the future!",Positive,357,68
Vorlun,2020-09-29 17:44:25,"Graphic alone is amazing, gacha is not really important in this game, its an adventure old school rpg, you can just obtain characters and equipment. Soo many stuff to do, amazing view like almost all time, the weather also cycles. Killing bosses way above your level is also an amazing experience. The only downside is that we need to keep changing characters instead of them controlled by AI instead",Positive,400,69
Thomas Ebbighausen,2020-10-11 07:23:48,"Breath of the Wild + anime styled rpg where you can play co-op with your friends cross console. You can text your party, run instanced single battle challenges, fight world bosses, and complete daily objectives. Everything you can do co-op, you can do single player. Co-op stops you from advancing story. Motions and controls are smooth on my note 10+. This is a great game, but can be improved. There is no pvp, online guilds, raid system, or competition, yet it uses gocha and season pass.",Positive,491,86
Nikita Butnarescu,2020-10-31 10:20:15,"Its by far the best game in play store, i ve played a lot of games but none can compare with genshin impact; just briliant game and gameplay",Positive,140,28

The graphics, the battle concept, and a suprisingly good and interesting grind. This is what i called a peak of gacha games. However there are some problems like slight bugs where some enemies tend to go invisible, and the story being slightly bland. Other than that this is a great game, 9/10 could recommend it to others.",Positive,419,78
Salvatore Carlton,2020-09-28 14:52:30,"Wow, the first thing that surprised me was the amazing graphics for a mobile game. Apparently this game is also on PC and PS4 which was pretty cool to find out. The closest thing I can compare this game to is a anime breath of the wild. There is a lot that this game offers with its playable characters and interesting story. Finally I went to settings and there was so many options like graphical changes and even gyro controls. One of the most impressive games I've found in a while. 10/10.",Positive,492,92

Its great, one of the best games this year, if not the best, i highly recommend playing it if you have been forever searching for a game in which you can interact with many objects and npcs, this game redefines mobile gaming.",Positive,291,53
Lorenzo Reed,2020-09-28 07:41:03,"I just quit Exos Heroes because the scout system, awakening, and signature force just totally killed the game for me. Genshin Impact is totally on a different level. I like games like this where you don't have to rush through a game just to keep up with other players. You play at your own pace. Yes, the gacha rates in this game is horrible right now and needs to be reworked by the devs. Plus, the graphics in GI is just truly amazing. This game continues to peak my interests at least for now.",Positive,496,94
Hamza G√ºm√º≈ü,2020-10-17 14:31:25,"I waited for this game for a year and....its finally out, i litterly waited on 28 September and it was really late like 3 am or something, so there are things that i dont like for example the controls and the camera, the camera zooms in too close sometimes and the controls, well its on a phone so you miss click sometimes and its really stressful sometimes, one more thing and thats gacha too get a 5 star character even if i finally have 1, its 0,600% change and i hope they change that, thats all!",Positive,500,96
adamsyah nugraha,2020-09-29 02:03:57,"Great game, actually i like how we able to discover our own team and not from gatcha only we can get some character but if you keep exploring the map, you can get some of the character, at least the minus is this game really push your phone to the limit and we can only see other player if we team up but for me is fun cause seing other player sometimes can make someone get irritated, even sometimes i think to change my phone to play this game, thanks for making a great game rpg, love it",Positive,490,98
Ed Ro,2020-10-12 04:19:28,"Miyoho Did it again another amazing peace of art....console quality game in the palm of our hand. Hand down to this wonderful open world Action RPG, solid story and easy fast pace controllers. There is a minor issue with the Network if you get a phone call or just want to look into another app for a minute overall it have my best interest. Definitely a must have.",Positive,365,68
dirtbag dustin,2020-10-01 18:58:21,"I dont know where to begin. I can't say enough good about this game. Its so fun, the characters are beautiful, the story isn't bad, I cant say enough good about this game. The only con about it is there aren't enough hours in the day to play it as much as I would like to. This might be presumptuous of me to say but Genshin Impact might very well be the best mobile game ever made. Mihoyo hit a ringer with Honkai impact 3rd, then decide to yeet passed that and give us a grand slam with Genshin.",Positive,497,99
NinjaNatsu Dragneel,2020-10-04 14:04:19,"My only complaints are that it drains battery really quick, but that is to be expected of a game of this calibur. Still a really great game overall, the gacha doesn't force you to use it to complete the story but is there if you want it. For the most part pay2win and free2play will have a similar experience difficulty wise",Positive,324,61
eman ambor,2020-10-13 14:20:40,"One of the best games right now. One thing that is not good is the battle pass, mathematically it is not feasible. Even if you play couple of hours everyday, you cannot reach level 50. They should rethink how the battle pass works. It should be more achievable for normal gaMers and also for those who want to buy it but cannot play more than couple of hours er day..",Positive,367,70
Sh√∏g√ºn Emper√∏r,2020-10-26 17:26:23,"This is the best game i have ever played , however my only problem is that i cant use my other server acc in another server, and i was stuck in the american server but my ping was lower in the asian server... but all my progress is in the american server...can you please make the server accounts be playable in other servers?? Please, it can help me a lot and a lot more people",Positive,378,75
The real Will,2020-09-28 09:06:22,"Good first impressions. The graphics are just about as good as I was expecting. Shadows are nice, crisp and detailed textures, although the distance rendering still does not impress me even at max and I wish there was an option for anti-aliasing. The english voice actors did a great job and the characters fit the voice quite well. So far this seems to be a very beautiful rpg that isn't overly confusing but will light your phone on fire.",Positive,440,79
shivanshu sharma,2020-09-28 15:52:03,"Truly amazing experience üôÇ. Kudos to the dev team for they made one of the most amazing game available on mobile platform. This game is a true work of art and dedication clearly shines through! Visuals are stunning, gameplay is fun and engaging. Only thing I'd like you to fix is the camera, especially when you fall, camera pans down and stays there. It's one of the few things which breaks immersion. Rest all is perfect. I'd also like to thank you for dedicating this much for mobile platform",Positive,495,89
Hardik Painter,2020-10-08 13:23:31,"It a great game overall but sometimes it just gets laggy or stuck at the main frame till the cinematic story ends..so I just have to wait staring at the frame while the voice is still running in background which is a bit frustrating and other than that.,the controls are easy to play and I love the fact how you can combine the skills and make reactions to easily defeat the enemies and ""FIRST OPEN WORLD GAME"" WITHOUT AUTO PLAY.. KUDOS TO THE TEAM AND DEVELOPERS..",Positive,465,86
sebastian murillo,2020-09-28 09:12:38,"Simply beautiful! Everything is top notch! Voice acting is great, the combat is soooo good like you can't compare it to any other mobile game out at the moment. Graphics are gorgeous, the controls are well thought and yes the game have some similarities to botw but it's unique in it's own way. Keep going guys this game is amazing :)",Positive,334,61
MomasterGod,2020-09-27 15:50:05,"I've played through the game twice, with 100+ hours. I can say this is one of the best games for mobile. It's f2p, has very good free characters so you don't have to spend $ (and it's a gacha so you'll get some 5* for free no matter what) and has loads of content. Additionally, there is no PvP so tier lists don't matter as even the worst characters can beat all content. Exploring the world is fun, as there is so much to do, and I'm still excited to do it again, even after doing it for 40+ hours.",Positive,500,100
Michael Stone,2020-10-14 10:00:32,"Other than the multiple pay walls I believe this game will be Mihoyo's best game to date, if they ever decide to make free full content games. I'd rather pay $70 for all content than pay # $300+ for some content, and the people behind Mihoyo games are the only ones who can bring gameplay to that level in my opinion. It is up to all of you to breach the next level, and I know that mobile gameplay is in but the profits are not because money is not the goal. True appreciation of art and skill wins",Positive,499,99
Gavin Bagus,2020-10-02 00:40:04,"I can't believe this game is free to play. You got 50+ hours worth of exploring the vast and beautiful world. Plus some nice story. Just the amount of content you got Vs the price of this game is horrendeus. Gacha rates are very low compared to other games, but considering what you got, is a fair way to monetize the game. You don't really need the 5 star character though. Some 4 stars are really strong in early game. Downside is, this game becomes grindy when you hit late game.",Positive,482,91
Chisato Onodera,2020-09-29 16:10:08,"Amazing, it's almsot absurd to think that this is a mobile game. Game is very generous, and you don't really need to pay to have access and thrive in end-game content. There are some flaws here and there, such as the graphics optimization for Exynos-powered devices (my personal gripe, as much as any Exynos users out there who play this as well), but it's otherwise near perfect.",Positive,380,67
ËôπËâ≤„É¨„É¢„É≥,2020-09-30 08:11:12,"One of the best game I've played in a long, long time. You can have a wonderful experience and a ton of different characters without spending a dime. Combat is smooth and interesting, and story is very good so far. The gacha is obviously the worst part of this, but to enjoy this game you really don't have to touch that thing ever. Though the game gives you a lot of premium currencies for everything you do in game, so you can have a relatively collection of gacha characters and weapons.",Positive,490,91
Chadd richardson,2020-10-03 05:46:22,"If I could only use one word to describe this game, that word would be, ""Gorgeous."" Everything about this game is gorgeous right down to the musical score. Even the english voice acting isn't terrible so far. Not only that, but the combat flow is smooth as silk, easy to navigate, and strategic in the right places. My only complaint is that moment around this vast world is kind of slow. I wish that we had more running stamina when not in combat.",Positive,448,83
Mark Seijitsunas,2020-10-01 09:18:36,"The voice of Paimon was really cute and pleasant to hear, I usually skip for dialogues but her cheerfulness keeps me hook in. The game experience is whole different from other high graphic games, no auto-pathing for quest, elements can be stacked and affect each other , like using a water element and changing it to lightning to make additional damage. There are riddles for treasure hunting, cooking, ingredient gathering and even gliding to avoid fall damage. Totally worth to play!",Positive,485,81
Devon Missildine,2020-10-01 01:08:11,"One of the best open world games I have ever played honestly. It is so good I don't care if it lags every now and then. Amazing job making this devs. It was so worth the wait. It's perfect from the graphics, to the voices, the story all of it. If I could give it 10 stars I would. If you could do something about optimization that would probably fix the lag problem. I would recommend this game to everyone.",Positive,407,80
Calvin Seven,2020-10-16 01:32:42,"been playing for 2 days now, the story is amazing, once I saw that there was a book collection I knew that the side-stories is gonna be mind blowing, and its like an upgraded runescape with so much freedom, the secrets are very fulfilling once you discover them yourselves(guides and walkthroughs are highly not recommended if you want the full satisfaction), I deleted 3 apps for the memory requirement and it was so worth it.thanks for developing an amazing game.",Positive,465,80
Rhiannon Russell,2020-10-08 14:34:33,It's a beautiful game and has an in-depth story. The game may lag sometimes but that's possibly cause there isn't a server that's near where I live and it's honestly not that bad. There's a lot of loading at the start so you need to be patient but other than that and cut scenes the game is almost load screen free despite the large open world experience it provides. All in all I really love it.,Positive,396,76
Kalle Pertland,2020-10-05 17:20:55,"Actually a very nice game that reminds me of Breath of the Wild and Nier: Automata with some added mobile gacha. Due to performance I prefer the Windows version, but the mobile version is extremely impressive in that it doesn't seem to strip away any gameplay features from the game, essentially giving you an experience that's comparable to playing a good game on a proper computer.",Positive,383,66
BlackLightMonkey,2020-10-02 10:40:12,"An exceptional game, a lot of time and effort has clearly been made to develop it. Graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the game combines the exciting elements of both gatcha and rpg games. As the memory space and hardware required is quite high, I would recommend playing this game on a high end phone.",Positive,303,54
Adam Chinchic,2020-10-05 13:27:09,This game is incredibly beautiful. The animations are seamless and the music is immersive. There are no ads and they don't push for you to pay for anything. It's a truly wonderful experience playing this game! The only thing I would change is making a way for players to use a bluetooth controller as the touch controls are a little difficult sometimes during intense battles.,Positive,376,65
Akane Miyoshi,2020-09-30 11:10:17,"This is the benchmark of mobile gaming, much like how Microsoft Flight Simulator is for PC benchmarks. The biggest fix that must be done here is optimizing the game for more devices to accomodate more players who love this game as much as I do. After hours of playing, this is totally beautiful and chill to play. The grind and story are fun, the world always has something special to offer, the bosses are fun but not too annoying, and Paimon is the best emergency food and companion. Recommended.",Positive,498,89
John Flores,2020-10-20 10:37:57,I love the game but I don't know if it because the game is new or if it is because of I am playing on mobile device but there are some parts of the game that lags so badly that I sometime think the game crashed on me. But other than that I love game I got a major vote vibe from the graphics,Positive,291,64
Evannie Gampawi,2020-10-02 18:26:18,"This... I really can't describe the feeling... This is truly one of the best game, literally. The story, the art, the music, it really are top-notch. Even though some might say its 'similar' to BOTW, but i would say this is an upgraded version of that. Thank you so much for developing such wonderful game!",Positive,306,55
Christopher Gonzales,2020-10-19 06:01:01,"This is an incredible game!! They have really outdone themselves!! Plays better then any other mobile mmorpg, and better than most console games (though you can play this on your console too of course). So highly recommended, get to playing.",Positive,241,40
Viktor,2020-10-07 20:52:01,"A game good enough, that I can play it on PC and my phone and it's fun on both. Fair micro transaction system where you don't feel the need to buy anything (but maybe will, to support the developers). Can thoroughly recommend it, although I don't know how all this applies to the late game yet.",Positive,294,56
Evan Frampton,2020-09-29 13:57:36,"This is the only mobile game I have liked ever, there is one thing that I don't like about it is the lack of controller support which is fine but I would prefer a controller and it makes it worse when you look at it on pc and console controller support it just makes it seem lazy that they didn't put controller support on the mobile version but the touch controls are pretty good and it doesn't take from the experience that much if at all and the music is really atmospheric with the big open world",Positive,500,97
Jamison Nickles,2020-09-30 06:17:09,"This game is what mobile gaming should head toward. A cross play title (ps4, pc, ios, android) that plays like a consol game. Its basically The Legend of Zelda: breath of the wild meets anime in a game. It's a gotcha game but don't feel pressured into spending money. Basically call content can be done with the free units without making a single pull. It's got a wide character roster with fairly distinct combat styles(though the do fall into categories). Highly recommend trying it out",Positive,488,85
Ahsan Masoud,2020-09-30 02:50:46,"Absolutely flawless. The game runs well on my phone and so far the story seems intriguing. Not only that but the characters are likeable and the game is very forgiving at the start, while also increasing its difficulty the more you play. Overall I had a great experience and will diligently wait until they add controller compatibility to the game.",Positive,348,60
TheSeasonedGuy,2020-09-30 19:07:29,"Really takes inspiration from the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and pulls off the concept well with functionality and style! I love how open and unrestricted you are for exploration. I think it was a good choice to not have an ""auto-move"" button as the charm of the game was really the exploration and combat! I'm currently at rank 10 and I don't know if we'll unlock more but it would be great if we could have more options to bookmark certain areas (i.e. dungeon, challenges) :D",Positive,486,89
Erick Cuello,2020-10-08 23:38:33,"I haven't found it, but if it isn't there, an ingame monster manual with all the tips we get would be nice. Also would like a way to locate my friends in coop other than scrolling the whole map searching for their icon. Besides that, great game, I'm enjoying everything so far. The graphics, the heroes, the challenges, and the facr that the whole game doesn't rely on the energy system.",Positive,387,71

Dean Sinclair,2020-10-02 08:19:34,"I'm constantly surprised at how good this game is. it's basically like any triple-A Nintendo title but it's actually been flawlessly ported in its entirety to a phone. This android version is identical to the PC version and I am just almost in disbelief. I can be playing on the PC and then just switch to my phone and it continues where I left off. basically, anime breath of the wild expansion. with better combat. and if I'm really honest, maybe a better story too.. and it's a much better RPG.",Positive,497,91
Lawrence Benedict,2020-10-06 19:56:50,"Flawless. This is definitely the best RPG game I have ever played so far. Stunning graphic, beautiful storyline, along with relaxing music made the game really addictive. Each NPC have their own story/dialogue. Yesterday, I have finished the Stormterror arc, and the story behind it really touches the heart. I wish I got Venti from gacha, but no luck instead. Then again, I am glad this game is not a pay to win type like most of RPG games out there. Keep up the good work.",Positive,474,86
Ross Belbus,2020-10-17 16:13:17,"Most enjoyable and immersive yet relaxing game i ever played on mobile, it is extra fun to play on the pc and then just open my phone and continue where i left, and paimon is a big plus to the experience, the UI and click sounds are perfectly splendid, the artifacts are a tad confusing and a bit hard to keep under control, but overall im enjoying this game very much, 5/5",Positive,373,72
Esai Castellanos,2020-10-17 09:40:33,"I honestly love this game it gives me some Assassin Creed vibes with you needing to be a certain rank or level to do certain missions and also having other tasks/mission's to do. I also love the story in it im not that far in it maybe about 25%? It's still amazing either way, also I love how huge the map is you get to explore and fight new monster's/creatures and not the same old ones over and over most of the time.",Positive,419,83
Jonas Koh,2020-10-13 12:51:10,"The graphics are amazing, love this game. But a suggestion is to have a honkai impact 3 crossover event. Maybe the event can have special quests to gain tokens to roll besides trading primogems for the tokens. As for the rewards maybe we could get a character that's not too strong but reasonably balanced for completing all the quests. The tokens could be special event summons to get characters like the herrescher of the thunder, wind, ice, flame representing electro, anemo, cryo and pyro",Positive,492,84
Lellobelle Dalamiq,2020-10-04 15:29:27,"I play primarily on PC (This is a cross-save, cross-play game between PC, Android/iOS and PS4). Genshin Impact follows miHoYo's top-class example of handling gacha perfectly by allowing you access to everything you will ever need without paying a single dime, making the spending of money a nice afterthought rather than a requirement. Gameplay is best compared to Zelda: Breath of The Wild - It takes heavy inspiration, trading out it's physics-based adventure gameplay for an element-heavy JRPG.",Positive,497,78
Rabbid Dawg,2020-10-14 10:59:53,"5+ hrs in and so far so good. Playing this both on the PC and android phone. beautiful game on both screens, gameplay is enjoyable and exploration is highly encouraged. Don't be too put off by the gatcha elements of game, the default characters have so far been effective enough to still very thoroughly excel at the game. Try to avoid making this out to be a 'BoTW' clone, there are more fully realized characters, a story and multiple worlds to explore. Give it a chance to impress you.",Positive,488,89
Josh Maybe,2020-09-28 23:39:38,"This is a must have game. The graphics are top tier and the gamplay is as good as you can get for a moble game. The voice acting is very likeable aswell. The only problems I've experienced so far are battery drain which is to be expected so not much of a problem and some of the more epic scale cutscenes will cut in and out. Overall this is definitely a game I would pick up if you like playing games on your phone. Side note the download is long but I'd still recommend it, took me a few hours.",Positive,496,100
Nicholas Hein,2020-09-28 12:33:01,"So far I am enjoying this game. I love the story line. You get to change characters which is awesome. We get an option to change voice language (amazing) and text language. So you can separate two languages. Character design is cute. One thing is inconvenient is that we do not get to autorun to a quest location. Lastly, I know they have monthly pass. But, It would be great if they have a lifetime pass that I could buy. Just to show support for the game as well as getting benefit in doing so.",Positive,496,95
Ean Singmouangthong,2020-09-29 10:45:39,"This has to be the best mobile games I've ever played (I also understand its on pc too and thats amazing). First I love the no ads and the no pay-to-win aspects. Second graphics and music are great too, and the controls/ interface are easy and simple. Lastly the story, quests and whatnot are great. To me this is on par with Zelda Breath of the wild, and if I could I would give it a 100 out of 5 stars. I'm only playing the beta currently but its still amazing and feels like a finished game.",Positive,494,97
Fajri Nur,2020-10-15 10:22:11,"Why is this free? This game is worth at least 60$. I don't know what witchcraft you people did to somehow fit all of this into a mobile phone, but I would like to say that I support it. Gameplay is great; at first, with the movement and puzzles, you can see why people call this game a ""Breath of the wild copy"" But the gameplay similarities ends as soon as we reach combat. The main focus of combat is elements, and these elements are also very reactive to the environment.",Positive,474,91
Stansla Michael,2020-10-05 19:02:46,"The game itself is a 10. There are however issues with mobile. Firstly no FOV. Is a must have especially on any Note Series.

I use a Note 10 plus even on the lowest settings it overheats.",Positive,341,64
Jon Eduardo,2020-10-07 22:37:07,"Love the games music and art, and combat is just so much with the different types of character abilites, traits and combos.

The quality of graphics, gameplay, versatility and voice acting is outstanding, there is something for everyone! I can't express how great the quality of this game is, and it being a free game with no annoying pop ups or adverts and with so much content it deserves a 5 star from everyone.",Positive,473,89
Shahib Al Bari,2020-10-06 07:28:16,"This game is so beautiful! This is the game that I think gives more freedom to the players to explore anywhere than others.

Brendan Murphy,2020-10-10 05:01:55,This is FAR closer to a game like Breath of the Wild than it is to anything you've ever played on your phone or mobile device. This is a AAA blockbuster game that is going to be one of the best games of the year for ANY platform including PC and consoles. Do yourself a favour and play this beautiful gem of a game FOR FREE!!! It's unbelievable that you can get a game of this incredible quality without paying a single cent.,Positive,425,83

Ze Booze,2020-09-30 05:17:04,"I absolutely love it! The graphics are nice, there's a wide variety of characters, and the developers are very generous. It's close to a dream RPG that I always wanted. There seems to be an issue though.. I tried to screen record, but the time I press the record button, the game just completely mutes. It's not my phone's problem because it supports internal sound (Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro) but the game mutes itself when I record. I'd be delighted if it's a bug that can be fixed!",Positive,482,89
Ariff Hizami,2020-10-15 05:27:15,"I really love this game. It is a computer game that can be played in mobile phones and other devices. It feels and looks great. Story is good and interesting. The only issue i have is your summon rate for the game. You'll need 90 summons for a 5 star equipment/character?! The summon rate is a bit too much. Maybe it can be reduced to 50 summons for a 5 star equipment/character for the friendly 'free to play' players who can enjoy the game. Other than that, best game so far. Love the mechanics.",Positive,497,94
Sugane -_-,2020-09-28 22:03:42,"Great game so far, just a few things that can be improved on. The graphics and story are amazing. There are some things that can be improved on like some quality of life changes and also the cutscene.

Sandra Goodhew,2020-10-13 05:34:05,"Can't Afford a switch or BOTW? Try this... While it's very similar, some of the gameplay mechanics are almost exactly like breath of the wild, it does have some differences. For one thing, there's not a princess in danger! If I could change anything about the game I would implement outfit changes. But God knows I have enough games that do that! Seriously, this game is awesome! It will eat your life! I can't believe they're not charging money for this!",Positive,455,81
Ali Mat Nor,2020-09-30 00:41:30,"Very akin to Breath of the Wild. Surprisingly friendly to my old Honor Play and the graphic options are adequate to boot. The gameplay's smooth with the absence of hand-holdy tutorials. Can be confusing at first but I find that if you don't stray too far from the story missions, all the mechanics and features are unlocked fairly quick. The ally switch utility sets it apart from BotW and Immortals: Fenix Rising as the functions like shields and buffs can be shared within the party.",Positive,485,85
Shooty McSnipe,2020-09-30 21:30:33,"So far so good , it is very well detailed and there is no energy system so thats a huge plus for a free game. Attacks are varied and character abilities , I'm constantly surprised by the depth. Not far enough to know if it becomes a cash grab paywall later for upgrading but so far I'm very impressed!!!",Positive,303,59
Gigi,2020-10-05 10:13:12,"For a free game and a mobile game it's absolutely amazing!!! I really enjoy the storyline, along with the beautiful graphics and soundtrack to go along with. I also love the open map and the different actions it has (walking, climbing, jumping, swimming, gliding) as it makes the game feel more free and not constricting. You should definitely give this game a try!!!",Positive,367,63
Sania Khan,2020-09-29 21:04:41,"I never ever write reviews and barely give ratings but this game is fabulous. I use a very normal mobile phone to play tho it does use a lot of RAM but it works for me. As a person who loves play PS, this has the quality like PS4 on your mobile! Never seen a game like this! For ppl who are worried about storage, this game will take extra 6GB after downloading from play store.",Positive,378,76
feardevil666,2020-10-13 04:04:51,"I really like this game, haven't had many issues except the one big one, the first CG did not work properly, then the cg for the dragon just before your gliding and shooting the dragon did not play either, I'd love to see leveling for cooking, and eventually some blacksmithing instead of the shop, make a mini game out of smithing like cooking has.",Positive,349,64
Loki Ras Reponte,2020-10-11 17:51:11,"My first 2 hour run was smooth, played on my mobile phone. And all I can say is, this is all I can give (5 stars), because Playstore review has no more than 5 stars to offer. There's an issue to copying a UID however, I can't paste it directly on a messaging app when I intend to send it to a friend.",Positive,300,63
Suhas Narahari,2020-09-30 13:20:07,"The graphics and cut scenes are gorgeous, and the battle mechanics are really intuitive. It operates like a good quality rpg, and even has a gacha system for new characters, each with their own incredibly diverse style. There are sometimes where the motion controls get a bit janky, but besides that the story and scenery are absolutely gorgeous",Positive,345,58
Ajuaba Rena,2020-10-07 03:43:59,"This is one of my top three best games in my history of gaming, like the characters, the quality, everything in it is simply perfect. You follow the navigation and your at your quest, you fly through the air and so many others. If you don't yet have this game, then ""your not a gamer"".",Positive,285,55
Naoko Teitsumi,2020-09-29 22:39:00,"Ive been awaiting this title for so long and I am in love and amazed! Every other mobile games have felt underwhelming ever since. I can see myself playing a long time with friends and cant wait to see whats in store for this game! Be it Android, PC or PS4, this game has run smoothly to me! Gameplay is adapted to every playstyle on all platforms and the characters and lore are a delight! Keep up the great work :D",Positive,416,81
Raging Bananas,2020-10-03 22:11:59,"Absolutely a fantastic game. I love it, cant get enough of it. But ine minor compliant is that, when i play the game, after around 5-10 min of playing. The sound gets extremely distorted. To the point where it sounds crackly and i cant make out what the characters or sounds are. It happens every time i open the game. The only way to stop it, is to close the game and re launch it. Hope it gets fixed soon, really takes away how much i can play.",Positive,446,88
YANI's Vlog,2020-10-17 06:49:50,"I love the game, over all the graphics the controls and most of all it has good Story, but it actually has problems I'm my case, Because in my device it kicks me out of the game and it says in the notification "" the game is crashing Contact Game developers"". It's from Wisdom engine in my device But the Is not even lagging or crashing It's annoying because, When I'm Killing bosses When the game quits The health of the boss is Restored while mine is Damaged, one more thing, the loading is veryslow",Positive,500,95
Chiyo,2020-10-01 06:20:37,"This may be labeled a gacha game, but make no mistake it's not in the league of others in that genre. It's definitely the best game I have ever experienced on mobile. It can also be played on pc using the same account. This makes it extremely diverse. I rarely give 5 stars to any app and even more rare do I write a review. The experience can't be explained in this amount given to review so I'll say if you're on the fence about it, make sure you fall to the same side millions of others did.",Positive,494,98
Kukuh Kurnia Naufaldi,2020-10-10 23:05:55,"This is the best mobile game ever! It has beautiful graphic, the gameplay is good, and the single player and the multiplayer is fun. My advice is can you please add more multiplayer feature like friends online notification and chat with friends without entering their world. It would be awesome if the game has this features!",Positive,325,56
Mai Nhan,2020-10-24 00:08:56,"This is the first time I've ever experienced such a magnificent gameplay. The story is intriguing, the graphic is undisputable vividly amazing, and the gaming control is thoroughly guided . Thanks for letting us experience such a great game!",Positive,241,39
Abhijith SJ,2020-10-03 21:59:52,"Best game ever, i really love the theme song (very heavenly), it feels like i got isekaied into that world, very good graphics, i personally face no issues with this game but one of my friend to whom i recommend this game to is facing some issues with graphics so he had to uninstall (he says ground is wierd and loads when went near and character models face is not loading,he has a 4 gb ram phone so it should have worked), try fixing that, great game",Positive,453,87
Chimene Huang,2020-10-01 15:33:09,"The game i played so far is a free world game. You get Main Story quests as well as other Side Quests. You're also free to pick materials and ingredients up. Art style is breath catching and voice overs are available in various languages. Some parts of the game interface however are still a bit hard to use. But if i have to compare it to another game, it'd be quite similar to Monster Hunter World, as for the level of freedom we have in the game.",Positive,449,87
Unijchque San Agustin,2020-10-02 13:23:47,"Console quality game for mobile! Full pledge rpg singleplayer game with Excellent Graphics. Didn't expect it to be this great, very addicting. Open world, explorations, dungeons with puzzle solving, gathering materials and smooth combat system and in-app purchases is decent. Over all recommended game, thank devs for this quality game on a mobile device, Good Optimization.",Positive,374,56
Ferdinand Von Aegir,2020-10-12 11:39:41,Its absolutely amazing. Its like zelda breath of the wild meets gotcha. Any unit in the game is perfectly usable (exept amber) so no need or desire to spend money. I've been playing for a while now and have reached adventure level 25 and haven't even used the co-op feature yet. I think It might be bigger then both skyrim and breath of the wild put together once all 7 kingdoms are added...,Positive,391,73
Muneeb Farrath,2020-10-04 05:16:44,"Breath of fresh air for a mobile game. Cross platform saving is amazing, meaning you can play on your PC or PS4 and on your mobile when you're on the go from where you left off. Visuals are stunning and the world is well designed. Lore is good and the battle system is fun. So far I have nothing but good things to say.",Positive,319,64
Kratos2696,2020-10-16 09:19:20,"Great rpg. And I really love that you can connect your account on the phone to your pc or ps4 account and pick up where you left off. Also I love that you can have english voices for the characters. Just wish that if you use a controller on pc that the game would remember it so I don't have to set it to controller each time I boot it up, but that's not a huge issue. Great game overall best free rpg game I've played.",Positive,419,86
Dijon Johnson,2020-09-29 18:05:29,It absolutely blows my mind that a game with this level of quality is free. I've already gotten hours of fun gameplay and didn't need to spend a dime. The game incentivizes you to explore and mess around but it doesn't restrict you with a recharge system or anything like that. The combat is fast paced and the way you can form and plan out team compositions is unique and innovative. I think this game is going to set the bar for free games down the road.,Positive,456,87
mogamogamoga,2020-09-28 23:22:47,"i am so glad to have played it on release. first of all, WOW!!!! the graphics are absolutely amazing, this is definitely one of the most visually appealing games i have ever played in my life, and its a damn mobile game. the color palette is just perfect. the music is beautiful as well, it just makes me sit down and listen to it. the best part however for me is definitely the scenery. there are so many beautiful places in this game. very recommend",Positive,451,85
Brian H. Adiwinata,2020-10-17 01:48:31,"First half an hour into the game and man, I love it! Reminds me of the old days I used to sit in front of my TV playing my PlayStation 2. Unfortunately, I just don't have the luxury to play these kind of games anymore. The open vast world, numerous quests, items collecting, etc., will be taking too much of my precious time; time which I'd rather spend wisely with my family and making money to get through the pandemic.",Positive,421,80
Trom Bey,2020-09-30 11:19:53,"My hope is this game can spark an interest in mobile gaming as a hardcore gaming platform. While there are a few faults in the game (would love to see the non-elemental combat system deepened further than a single attack combo and hold attack) everything is very well polished, well thought out, and far exceeds my expectations following the game's development, with tons of content for a free to play title. Good job Mihoyo for smashing this one out of the park! I hope for your continued success.",Positive,498,88
Funk Commander,2020-10-09 20:14:31,"This game captures the essence of what makes a great game great. The open world is full of wonder. You'll stumble across puzzles, chests, and fights. The real time combat is extremely satisfying too. You use your party to combo off powerful spell combos. Fire melts ice, causing the status effect ""wet"". Once they're wet, zap them with lightning and watch a beautiful explosion of lightning across your screen. The game is gorgeous. The animation is top notch and the world you roam is huge. 10/10.",Positive,498,86
„Çµ„Ç§Xai,2020-10-04 19:51:38,"Game is good, PVE open world, Gacha too, character wish system are pretty gamble, hard to lvl up if you're a free to play player. You can lvl up fast if you'll use money to buy ingame currency you can also use it to gamble gacha characters or grind for free to get primogem(used for getting gamble characters,weapon) if you're not competitive and just want to enjoy and kill time, then I recommend this game.",Positive,408,75
Neo Idnu Majab,2020-10-05 13:53:03,"This is not your run of the mill MMORPG. The game gives you a lot to do while being immersed in a fantasy world, and it's free for the most part. In terms of hardware, despite of the cell-shaded anime style graphics, it will make your phone scream for more power. Playing it on a good phone would help if you want the best experience. I am playing it with my S10+ with graphics set to the highest limit yet I do experience minor FPS drop oncecin a while.",Positive,454,89
Jess Mart B. Anticamara,2020-09-29 21:59:26,"The best game I played in my life! I love everything in this game. Even at low settings, the graphics and quality is still superb. The map is big so it's quite adventurous and exciting! I hope there's a hidden/secret dungeon and gives a super rare item like in some anime , can't wait to find it!",Positive,296,57
Sumit Yadav,2020-10-27 17:11:53,This is one of best games available in whole play store.. in terms of open world you get huge map with complete freedom to roam around.. personally i live open world games n tried so many games before but they were not upto it but this game is just awesome.. big in size but absolutely worth it,Positive,294,57
Daffa Fathir AT 07 IXD,2020-10-05 18:20:14,"This is the best game I've ever played after honkai impact. The graphics, soundtrack, and the story are absolute gorgeous. Even i only got 20 fps in game, i still enjoy this game. I like to see a development on mid spec phone, and if u can fix the connection problem it can be very helpful. Give it 5 star to Mihoyo for making a great gameüëç",Positive,340,67
Kayleigh Billings,2020-10-11 01:56:29,"This game is amazing! Everything thing you do has a purpose, and it feels good to play. The world is large and constantly expands. This game supports F2P gamers by having everything you need in chests / quests, and having their store sell only what you find in the game to save time. Their prices are fair, and I don't feel like I am being duped by what I am purchasing. The developers have thought of everything, and listen to requests from their gamers. I will be playing this game FOREVER.",Positive,492,91
LegendaryJas _X_ MisterLegend,2020-10-02 23:57:03,"I've never seen a game in mobile with this level of polish and yet I am very excited with all the things you'll be adding in the future like expansions, seasons, actual cosmetic items or other forms of character customisation. You can even play it and have fun without buying anything, which is rare considering its on mobile. I truly do appreciate the effort you've put into this game, something I've never seen from any mobile game before. Giving a 5 star review is the least that i can do.",Positive,492,90
George Almyroudis,2020-10-06 05:53:41,"An absolute must for open-world RPG fans. After playing dozens of hours, I'm still mind-blown on how this mobile game (multi-plaform really) has such jaw dropping graphics and art. If there's anything I'd change, it would be to give characters additional skills. Other than that, I'm truly impressed.",Positive,300,48
Roy Roger Jorquia,2020-10-11 07:11:21,a really nice game. an open world where you are free to explore. quests really makes you go out and explore the map yourself and stumble on mini adventures along the way. it does not bore at all when you are playing solo unlike other online MMORPG where the AI bot almost does all the moving and attacking in just a click of a button.,Positive,334,65
biswajeet techie,2020-10-10 06:23:06,"This game really impacted over my brains. I mean this is the first time in my life where i dreamt about a games, getting powered up and planning strategies to complete quest in my dream world. This game is very addictive, truth to be told this is not just a game this a totally different world and beleive me if humans don't needed sleep i would have played this all the time. Something really arrived for those otakus like me who always wanted to go to an isekai world. Only play if you have time.",Positive,498,95
Martin Bakunawa,2020-10-03 00:48:16,It really deserves its good ratings! The Finally a chinese game that doesnt feel like a rip-off. No VIP levels and no aggressive e-commerce ads and not pay to win. The winning shot is the game design and beautiful artwork. I really like how the game looks and feels. Although it could have been great if it was an MMO game.. but its a Gacha rpg so it is interesting for me. Plus this is what SAO should have look like. Bandai could learn a thing or two from Mihoyo. Hats-off to the devs!,Positive,487,94
Nivenfaal Windstot,2020-09-29 20:26:28,"Incredible production value game that will suck you in for hours. Slightly annoying to play on phone, but you get used to it. You can also get your wanted characters guaranteed as long as you learn to save up, since the ""pity"" guarantees the rate-up. The only current concerns are all very long-term, so I won't even mention them. Nothing but good things to say so far.",Positive,369,67
Oo F,2020-09-30 21:05:25,"I've been playing since it opened so about two/three days and honestly it's so obvious that so much hard work was put into this. The voice acting, the characters, the scenes, the attention to detail is amazing. The gacha is a bit iffy but that's expected. Everything else is pretty free to play. This game is amazing and I can't wait to see what the future holds. Good job to the devs and everyone who worked on this project!",Positive,425,79
Lillian Reid,2020-10-04 07:02:49,"I've fallen in love with this game. It's everything wonderful the other commenters are saying! I have been waiting so long for a mobile game like this! I play it like I do any sandbox - with complete freedom and taking my sweet time grinding to become OP before continuing the story. So many beautiful places to explore! You can climb anything, anywhere - trees, buildings, and cliff sides! Challenging beasts to fight, but it doesn't level up too fast or slow. Geeze, just so much fun to be had!",Positive,496,90
Leonardo Taufan,2020-09-28 16:16:20,"So far, I'm loving the story, the open world aspect, the gameplay--almost everything. If I have to nit-pick something, it would be the lack of control customization. I need to move that analog stick a bit higher since it feels a bit too low. Also, I think some optimization might be needed since my phone is currently cooking Tenderloin Steak since it heats up so much. But overall, this game is really amazing and worth recommending to others; keep it up!",Positive,456,81
Christian Sandoval,2020-09-28 13:16:37,"This game is graphically, and just so stunning to look at! The controls are simply to use, and the voice acting is just incredible. I'm playing this on my Mi 9t! And so far it hasn't drained my battery after an hour of playing. I highly recommend playing :)! Something worth nothing though, the PvE controls and be a little funky but not totally game breaking. Just thought I would point it out :). Again I highly recommend this game!!",Positive,435,80
RedRovaeden,2020-09-29 23:26:36,"Best mobile RPG I've ever played! I love how there's a lot of discovering and lots of exploring, I really like how there's hidden quests too. The voice acting is a little above average and the animation is crazy good! Not only that, there's many features that I never thought I'd even see in the game and the tiny features just makes it even better! I've been hoping for a game like this for a long time to get released on mobile. I just wish mobile racing games would be as similar as this.",Positive,491,94
Zander Mayor,2020-09-28 16:03:32,The game is fine actually I love the animation even though i cant play it by now (i only watch some gameplays to spoil myself). I think making a pvp mode will make the game more interesting (just separate the download so it is optional for the player). Just a suggestion. I only play a glimpse of the game since my cellphone cant support it but ill try it in computer soon as we buy.,Positive,383,75
nathan randall,2020-10-02 02:10:30,"Great game. Thankfully a game that gives me the experience of zelda botw. Since I don't have a switch lol. If you are tired of todays hardplay games like battle royale,moba and repetitive gacha game . I recommend this game. Relaxing, vast open world, chilling ost and great graphics. However do keep in mind the downside of this game is that it require pretty high end chipset. Well it needs to render the high graphics nothing can be do about it. I think snapdragon that above 800 will do fine.",Positive,495,90
Unkn K,2020-10-17 12:08:06,"To be honest, I played this game on my laptop since my phone is not good enough. But as I can say from my experience, this is a great game. The control is easy enough to be understand, especially for the ones who are new to this kind of game. This game also make sure that F2P players can still progress without needing to spend any money (of course P2W players will progress much faster). Other than that, the world is big for players to explore without being bored. Surely 10/10.",Positive,481,91
Kian M. Unreally,2020-10-06 19:47:22,"I really like the game so far, my only concern in this game is how grindy this game was. Would be a good idea if the world rank increase, the reward of adventure rank also increase a bit, especially when finding chest. Hope in co op can have some feature like sharing quest, what I mean about that is if the host pick a quest, the other player can do the quest but not for story mode and other quest that have high value of reward like high amount of adventure rank. That's just my thoughts",Positive,490,96
Erik Annis,2020-10-02 03:37:20,"Where do I start? Big world, tons to do and collect, even more coming. Haven't had any issues on my S9+ and can seamlessly transition to PC. Controls can be a bit of a pain on mobile, especially if you are maining an archer (then mouse and keyboard is infinitely better). Rates are a bit low on the gacha, and that is my only real gripe.",Positive,337,66
Brenden Howard,2020-10-03 12:16:48,"I am honestly thoroughly suprised. I found this game via an add on FB and expected it to just be another 2bit spinoff... And sure the animations and voice acting dont fully sync (or even go on for the same time) but as for a stand-alone RPG game on a mobile device.. this is the largest scale sandbox.. like true sandbox (in the realm of Zelda BotW grade) that i have to date...story progression is bearable, plenty of enemies, fun characters.. i can't wait to see how this game grows in the future.",Positive,499,93
Josue Zuniga,2020-10-06 11:17:58,"So far so good the game has been a very fun experience so far. Nothing seems to scream pay to win, there isn't a push for micro transactions. And they also gave me alot of goodies just for playing the game as a token of thanks. Game play is fluid and smooth, combat is simple nothing complex simple controls. Graphics are very good on mobile, and you can choose graphic quality to either increase detail or performance. Unfortunately there isnt any controller support yet. Hopefully there is soon.",Positive,497,88
Pranay Kumbha,2020-09-27 15:49:15,"Alright guy, I know the game hasn't released yet, but I've personally played the beta tests and watched a lot of streams and this games the best game I've ever played on mobile. The only problem would be that the game's heavy grind. Even whalers have to grind at a certain point. And also, a lot of people call it botw copy.. But its false! I've played the game and the only common thing is the game mechanics which is the same for every other new genre that releases. The two games are different!",Positive,497,94
Seren Dipity,2020-10-01 02:56:03,"Its literally superb! Its not complicated and hard to farm materials, easily be transported to different places and regenerate health just by standing beside the statue. What's more great is the story. Its getting more interesting as the your character become strong! Its competitive enough fighting bosses 15-20 higher levels than your advent rank since it doesn't have time limit. A battle of endurance and dodging skills perhaps. A gave it a 5* as the game is just superb",Positive,474,79
Derek Larsen,2020-10-20 05:08:09,This game has been nothing short of phenomenal. But there's only one thing and that is that there's no controller support. The base controls are probably as good as they can be but adding controller support will make this the perfect mobile game hands down.,Positive,257,45
XanD3R,2020-09-30 08:56:03,"Very innovative game for a ""mobile game"". I could say this truly feels like a true gaming experience on a mobile phone, Very Clean User Interface, fluid combat mechanics, truely open world again on a ""Mobile device"". Mihoyo as usual setting benchmark for other ""autoplay, loading screen, clutterfestUI rpg on playstore"". People may not realise it but this game truely is a benchmark. This is a real Game and the rest are apps on Playstore. Stop looking at self questing videos and PLAY THIS instead.",Positive,499,85
Nikita Smolyakov,2020-10-07 04:10:09,"10/10 game, just play it because you will enjoy it for sure (recommend the PC version). However don't even try to get the characters you want, not worth it (0,6% drop rate, worst drop rates of any gacha games). Just play it for the world and the story, support the devs with the welkin moon or the battle pass and bail out after.",Positive,329,63
LavaJCI,2020-09-28 12:12:46,So far this game is wonderful. Evokes strong breath of the wild vibes but still feels very distinct from it. Characters feel different and have some fun nuance. All the voice acting really adds to the experience too. Feels like it could have easily been a $60 console game for the quality. Definitely recommend to at least try it. (Also it's on PC too and has cross-save and cross-play. Not to mention it has 4-player co-op!),Positive,425,76
Kal Baxter,2020-10-12 22:52:08,"I play this one PC and on my Samsung galaxy note 9. It runs very smoothly. Even setting it to high graphic sexttings in the phone still runs at 60 fps with only minor overheating. The game is fantastic. I highly recommend. Play on either PC, phone or PS4 for free. You can play with your friends regardless of which platform you choose. Needless to say I tip my hat to the devs and am most Definitely a fan of this game and look forward to see where it goes from here.",Positive,468,92
JM Morales,2020-09-29 23:55:14,"This game is good, however, it is still buggy. When there is an interlude, my screen would hang but the sound still goes on, after that I'll be at where was I last went. Still this game is good when there is less bugs. I hope you compensate this bug. This game is well developed, has a great creativity, and a good animation. I'll be looking forward for this game to be more good and less bugs.",Positive,394,77
pikachu gaming366,2020-10-11 14:42:21,"This game is very extremely amazing, i hope that its available for all different kinds of mobile devices because i wanted my brother to join in this game with me but sadly he is using a stylo 4+ phone ,and it doesn't even show up for him unless if its available, i hope this is very helpful to give a heads up to the game developer to help let him/her know to make it available for all mobile devices to be able to play the game.",Positive,429,86
Joseph,2020-10-03 10:13:46,"I really like this game, it has beautiful graphic and it is on Android platform. The character movement weren't jagged and it was very high quality. I kinda wish it has joystick support so I could view it without covered with on screen button. About co-op thing, at least make a ballance drop with another player who come to the host map since the other party would only get 1% drop or even none of it",Positive,401,76
Breakfast,2020-10-02 05:22:44,"You have a a full game not only designed for PC and Console (PS4), but available on your mobile device. Sure your mobile device might tank but having this option is more than amazing. Still, my only issue is the random frame drops even with 30 fps playing solo. How much more with co-op?",Positive,287,54
Paul Lee,2020-10-01 11:52:35,"Probably one of the most visually impressive mobile games I've come across. The music in this game is also very soothing and meshes very well with the ""Breath of the Wild"" art style. For a mobile game, the quality they deliver is impressive. My only criticism so far is the the rather stingy drop rate of the 5* heroes - 0.6Ÿ™ drop rate. However the 4* heroes are pretty much guaranteed, and a good number of them are capable of carrying you through the game.",Positive,458,85
"Hey, It's Hei!!",2020-10-03 14:36:06,"i really love your game! my only feedback is, though this is only minimal, but ever since your recent update, i am getting random lags/delays.. my first 5 hours of gameplay was superb but got slightly pissed when these random delays comes at bay.. though it is playable, i wanna play your freakin' great game with no ease.. any improvements would be greatly appreciated.. more power!",Positive,383,66
Marvin Satparam,2020-10-03 00:10:21,"Ok.. overall it is amazing so i will state some bug that i experienced in the game, sometimes the walking pad starts to lock and the character will walk on its own another. My suggestion is to optimize the game graphics so that even those players that play in lower end phones can experience smooth gameplay even in lower graphics. I hope this suggestion of mine will be notice so that me and my friends can have fun in the future :)",Positive,433,82
Prudence,2020-10-18 09:46:24,"I've been a gamer for decades now...aside from Honkai Impact, this is the first mobile game which has great graphics - optimized for phone gaming plus superb gameplay, storyline, open-world style and to top it all - free to play! Thanks developers! Gamers around the world are truly grateful. Don't change!",Positive,306,51
Rijul Mandloi,2020-10-01 09:51:48,"This is a very epic game overall. Combat system is soo nice, instead of attack spamming you really have to use tactics to beat the enemies. There are some flaws like the cutscenes are boring (but the story is good). But beating some boses and mini boses was fun. And if u are just wandering u surely will come across some high level enemy which will be fun to beat. I still dont understand the waepon upgrade system. Graphics are epic and requires very high end device even my oneplus 8 gets overheat",Positive,500,93

Elena Konama,2020-10-16 09:16:50,Really really has the wow factor and the graphics are just on point. The cut scenes did lag at the start but after a bit it went back to normal. Gameplay is really captivating and the characters have their own personality which is really nice. I only have a question and it's if there's gonna be a feature where you can date some of the characters? Cause I got that impression after a few of the storylines hinted at it.,Positive,420,80
Jorvan Anggara,2020-09-28 12:53:16,"Is this game for real?? Such a sophisticated game for free?? Cross platform?? What more would you ask. This game is super awesome.

Nakia Merchant,2020-10-03 05:12:28,"I love love love this game! I've been looking for open world games for awhile now, and I couldn't find anything decent until I found this game. The only problem I have is how laggy the game is. Probably because it's still new. And how long and slow the downloading process is (However, please don't let that stop you from getting this game). Aside from that, I highly recommend this game! Also, please excuse my poor grammar lol",Positive,428,78
Nebulacore98,2020-09-30 18:17:46,"One of the best open world games for mobile. The game is also available on PC & PS4 which allows for options. The graphics are on par or dare I say, better than Mihoyo's previous game-Honkai Impact. If you go off the beaten path, you can find chests which contain items (even from the beginning of the game!) which puts a whole new meaning to open world than just story driven. Unlike most open world games, the game navigates you than automatically moving your character. Story is great too!",Positive,492,89
Carlos Conde,2020-09-29 15:55:56,"It's still relatively new and me a new player but this early, the game is very entertaining and I didn't feel like giving up on the game, lots of mini/side quest, challenges are scattered inside and outside the city, the gacha seems fair enough for now I guess, just a bit clueless on what to do first to rank up faster but overall as a new game I give it a 5 for now, and will still play and see if it lives up to the hype, oh and another thing, I seem to be having a problem with adding my friend",Positive,498,102
BOB SMITHERS,2020-10-06 19:22:39,Finally a free to play game that doesn't throw so many ads or try to force to buy things with real money. You guys finally done it this is how you win the west. No auto questing.cross saves with pc. Runs smoothly on my razer phone 2. Sweet story line. There is lots to do in Genshin Impact. It does feel like there's so much more potential left in this get.

Matthew Fitzpatrick,2020-10-09 18:16:32,"It took over 3 hours and upwards of 50 attempts to ""download resources"" in the app and actually install the game. That aside, this is clearly an awesome game after just a few hours of play. Fully voice acted, smooth combat, huge item and character variety, nuanced crafting and cooking... and from what I understand, there is no hard paywall whatsoever. This really is a triple A title for free. I haven't found the optional system to gamble on loot and pay for this game yet, but I will do it.",Positive,494,91
Future Fox,2020-10-02 15:55:57,"This game is AMAZING! I dont normally go for games like this, especially in the app store. Most of these types need money or something time consuming.

I literally got my whole family to download it and now this is our new family game night game!",Positive,410,76
Van Chung,2020-10-04 10:48:28,"First of all, I can't believe this game is free. While playing, you will forget that this is a gacha game because you are busy exploring the vast world. Genshin Impact has raised the bar for a cross platform game. I hope to see more updates in the future and wishing that this game will continue to be one of the greatest games of all time.",Positive,340,66
WWfire,2020-10-02 12:53:54,"Outstanding revolutionary console-in-mobile game This is probably the only mobile game I don't regret waiting to download 5GB+ in size. It exceed my expectation in terms of quality and the open-world exploration. I'm a bit skeptical at first when people say that it's more or less BotW, but I was wrong. The game is non-competitive, so you can spare the worry of having ""whaler"" hindering the experience, and it's more of a single-player anyway rather than PvP!",Positive,461,77
Cybertronlaser,2020-10-01 08:20:06,"This game is the best game on phone I have ever played. This game's visuals are stunning and absolutely beautiful. Very good waifus, amazing plot, HUGE world, and the best part is that it's all online after a certain level. If you have a phone that can run it, go delete some of your other games or apps and give this a go. It is 5 gigabytes VERY well spent.",Positive,358,70
Adrian Cole,2020-09-28 14:00:47,"I cant really base my review off of the mobile version yet, but ive already started playing the PC version and i gotta say its amazing that this beautiful game is free.. graphics, characters, voice acting and gameplay are on par with other fantastic open world AAA titles, so far im loving the cross element gameplay, so u can mix and match your characters to suit your playstyle. Im definitely looking forward to seeing this gem üíé grow and shine as they continue updating new features and fixes!",Positive,496,88
A Google user,2020-10-07 21:46:31,I have probably never had more fun with a mobile game. This game just looks so good and plays great even on the pc.

Robert Clarke,2020-09-30 08:23:30,"Im playing on PC mainly, but my lord is this an amazing game! The fact that a game of such high quality is free is honestly almost impossible to believe. Sure, having a gatcha system kinda blows but for the size of this game and the amount of variance different characters create ill gladly accept the gacha. 10/10 would gladly purchase a game of this magnitude and quality.",Positive,374,68
Jason Gary,2020-10-03 08:48:58,"I can't believe this is a mobile game. It's simply that gorgeous and robust. It is being called a BotW knock-off, but it's got its own identity, and in some ways (story, character development, combat), it's actually superior. Best of all, the game gives you good characters who can absolutely carry a F2P player. I'm deeply impressed.",Positive,334,57
Josie !,2020-09-30 08:30:08,"This game is AMAZINGG! I'd pay for it if it wasn't free. The graphics are so smooth. The gameplay is awesome. There's so much to do and explore. Even the English voice acting is good which is a rare find in these free games, usually the acting is terrible. Also games like this are usually a bit laggy on my phone but with this one I have experienced no lag at all. Perfect. ALSO THERE ARE SUPER CUTE DOGS IN THE GAME BUT U CANT PET THEM PLS UPDATE SO WE CAN PET THEM.",Positive,468,94
Wolf Spined,2020-09-30 11:53:06,"The game has been a joy so far. I haven't encountered any bugs or issues with the Gatcha system, having registered before release was able to obtain a nice array of characters. Graphics are beautiful, combat is excellent, the storyline developing nicely if somewhat aimed at a younger marker. As always it will be end game where issues with grind or pay to win start emerging. It's too early to predict how this will go. Noone should be adverse to paying for a good game though.",Positive,478,86
XxReaper 12,2020-09-30 18:01:10,"This game actually really surprised me. When I first heard of it being a gacha game I thought itd be something average like Bleach Brave Souls or Fire Emblem Heros, or Fate Grand Order. But what we got instead, was actually a fairly inspired game that plays like a mixture of Breath of the Wild and Monster Hunter. I didnt expect a full blown story with a very well developed world. This game really stood out with just how good it is, even for a gacha game.",Positive,458,87
Scales are my thing,2020-10-08 03:55:03,"I'm usually not someone who likes RPG games like this but, this is an exception. The art is amazing and it runs well on my device. Unlike other RPG's this game isn't always bombarding you with long dialouge and cutscenes. The game let's you do what you want and its actually possible to get where your going without having to use the navigation tool. It really does a good job at making the game play match the world (open world). In the end its a 10/10 in my books.",Positive,466,89

Tstar 2006,2020-09-30 00:32:55,I have had a really good experience playing the game and have been trying to hold in my excitement since the beginning of the year. The gameplay is really smooth and I enjoy using the unique movesets on each character. I also love gacha as well as open world games so putting together was a great idea (gacha is optional). One problem is that every time I leave the app and come back it says reconnecting but I can understand why and it doesn't take that long so it's not too much of a problem.,Positive,494,95
Aprixia,2020-09-30 18:10:42,"I love the game. It's the best Action RPG I've played. It is quite heavy for my phone, and it gets heavier as I progress. Though, now I mainly play it on my laptop, where it's surprisingly smooth. And to be fair, my phone isn't exactly meant for games, but can handle this one quite well. The graphics are amazing, and the fact that it's anime styled makes me love it even more. The game in a whole is amazing. You will not regret playing this game. Don't miss out on the amazing experience!",Positive,491,94
Spa Ghet,2020-10-08 15:49:13,"Honestly I'm suprised this is even on mobile, it totally is worth every minute you spend in also the fact that it's free is also a great deal.

It's all just amazing that you can give this away for free. I haven't fealt pressured to pay anything like all other Freemium games, I'll probably choose to spend money on it because you've made an amazing game here! Thank you! Two suggestions so far though... First, Xbox port would be top tier (Big ask though). Second, I would like to be able to pet the dogs ^^",Positive,496,92

Derek Fritz,2020-10-09 12:05:36,"Astounding quality for a mobile game, and the fact that you can pick up where you left of between PC and mobile with no hassle is amazingly convenient.

I do, of course, have reservations regarding end game considering Mihoyo's reputation with other games. Paywall seems likely as does limited progression if you aren't rocking 5* gear and characters. That aside is totally free and by the time that happens I will have gotten many hours of enjoyment from it.",Positive,410,70
Angel Cosme,2020-10-08 10:40:25,"This game is absolutely amazing. Astonishingly beautiful and overwhelmingly fun. This has to be the best game on mobile, hands down. It's a full, legit game but on mobile and the story is second to none. I wouldn't be surprised if this was up for Game of the Year. Bravo to the developers!!!",Positive,291,53

mohd tirmizi,2020-10-07 00:05:14,"Has become One of my favourite open world game in Mobile. Have been wait for long for storyline open world for Mobile. But i have some internet connection problems, so if the game can be play offline it will be nice. You just need to online if you want to claim daily comission, mail, coop, gacha etc. You can explore the world in offline mode n doing story quest n other quest.",Positive,378,72
€åÿ≤ÿØÿßŸÜ ÿßŸàŸÑ€åÿß€å€å,2020-10-07 01:16:21,Undoubtedly the best mobile game EVER. It has everything you want from a game. And vastness of the map is just crazy. But there is still so much to improve specially in online mode that i hope it happen in future. Anyway i surely recommend this game to all of you. It really worth your mobile storage üòÖüòÖ,Positive,303,58
ArmorXIII,2020-09-28 11:43:56,Does my eye deceive me or do we have an actual mobile game gives a reason why we need gaming phones. I was at awe of how smooth this runs on my phone. I didn't expect the game to be this beautiful and run decent on a phone. Lemme emphasis running on phone. This games feels like a flagship for mobile phones already. This game resembles alot of Breath of the Wild. And for it to have gameplay and aesthetics like that (FTP too). Easily one of the best games released in 2020.,Positive,475,93
The BaneSword,2020-10-02 12:28:16,"I never thought I'd see a game like this. I mainly play it on PC, but just having the ability to transfer my save to my phone and play it anywhere feels AMAZING. My phone runs a little slow, and loading times take a while, but it works. The game feels like what Breath of the Wild would be as a gatcha game but also stands entirely on its own. Being able to have a vast open world like that on my phone is just mindblowing.",Positive,423,86
Nilava Kanjilal,2020-10-01 21:18:34,"This game is full of life, with the beautiful graphics and the pleasant soundtrack, not to mention that the storyline is also interesting to hold my interest .And the best thing that the world of the game is Pretty big so i could as much as I want. But sometimes it reconnect to the server or I could not change to character and other small problems .",Positive,351,67
ParadoxIcal,2020-09-29 15:42:10,"I have loved playing Honkai Impact 3, and this game developed by the same creator has blew my mind more than honkai ever did! No openworld rpg game can compare to this in any way. There is so much content it's almost overwhelming, but when you stop doing quests you can just take in the beautiful landscape to feel calm and relaxed, as if you were transported to another world. Honestly one of the best games I have ever downloaded.",Positive,432,80
Ivan Lara,2020-09-29 00:46:51,Mihoyo really outdid themselves with this one. First thought it was too ambitious. Turns out it is a really awesome rpg reminding you of the recent tales games crossed with breath lf the wild. And making it cross platform is A really. Bold move got it on pc mobile and ps4 ( hoping that you guys can include it in the cross progression like SOOOOON PLEEEEASE ) and if you guys could pls consider real time pvp that would be great. All in all solid game give it a shot highly recommended!!!,Positive,489,92
Earth's Core,2020-10-02 19:32:18,"I almost never rate my apps but games like this is exeptional and if anyone is wondering whether or not it is worth the phone storage it takes up, the answer is yes. I did however encounter a slight glitch in the intro story animation where the audio and images were breaking up but it did not last. The controls are smooth and the environment you can interact with are surprisingly many. I cant even imagine the kind of work that was put into this to achieve this level of detail. Love the art.",Positive,495,94
Whistlin,2020-09-29 12:45:15,"It makes my phone far too hot after hours of play (a conflicting problem). I have too many good things to say.

It's literally free to try what is hands down a heavy weight of a game forever.",Positive,300,57
Random Stranger,2020-10-13 09:08:04,"This game is beautifully written, and excellently designed. Overall, I love it, through and through. My only complaint is the Gacha System mechanics of the game, but they surprisingly don't hinder the game experience at all! You can FTP easily, (and the in game spending mechanics do not get in the way whatsoever) and the game itself is gorgeous. An absolutely stunning gem, and I would recommend it to anyone interested. Overall looking forward to watching this game progress! 10/10 would recommend",Positive,500,82
X-D-J,2020-10-07 01:23:01,"This game just gets better the more you advance in the story, the gacha rates are fair, the gameplay is great and the massive open world is stunning and even with the graphic quality set on low it still looks good. I'm shocked this game was free. I hope the next game you devs make will good as well even though this one is my #1 right now.",Positive,340,68
operach S,2020-10-11 00:58:07,"Breathtaking game. The fact that a game like this can run on a phone is beyond me, the story and graphics are close to the best I've seen. I like that you can link the mobile progress with your PC, but I would also like to see that feature on the PS4, I spend most of my time on it and I think it's a shame that I can't link it with my phone and PC.",Positive,349,76
Nova Stardust,2020-10-11 10:24:36,Yoooo this game is üî• dude. The only thing I have against it so far is that it need internet to play and my internet sucks ü§£. If I can play this offline then there's a good chance of me playing hundreds of hours on this game. Got to the part where u get a glider. It runs great and feels smooth. Up until my internet craps out on me then I get lag and chunky gameplay. But still üî• tho.,Positive,384,81
aya mazaya,2020-09-30 12:29:49,"I really enjoyed this game so far, definitely the best free open world mobile game yet. I thought the comments are too good to be true but i proved it, it's that good. The clunky movements and long time to download are also true but that's to be expected, I'm just glad I'm not of those that didn't get to play at all. Also I'm still hoping it would be a premium paid game cause I'm never really a fan of mandatory in app purchases for achievements",Positive,448,87
Tyler Black,2020-10-12 04:39:11,"The new ""Gold Standard"" of mobile gaming! Incredible graphics, smooth gameplay and great music and voice acting. Runs better than Breath of the Wild does on my switch at higher resolution 1080p). Probably the single best mobile game there is at the moment. Tested using a Xiaomi Mi 9T. Seems to work great despite many people saying you need a Snapdragon 855 and up (using a Snapdragon 730 in my Mi 9t). ADD CONTROLLER SUPPORT PLEASE!! All it needs to be absolutely perfect.",Positive,474,83
Lieke van Dijk,2020-10-07 05:55:06,"A very nice game! I definitely prefer the pc version over the mobile one as its easier to control, but the mobile one works good. My luck is extremely bad in the gacha aspect, but you don't necessarily NEED to pay in order to play properly. Would highly recommend, the developers did nd are doing a very good job! Props!",Positive,320,60
bolt powers,2020-10-02 05:35:19,"I'm surprised this game is free because I would pay 60$ for this beautiful game, for a short summary this is a breath of the wild inspired gatcha game, with is absolutely incredible because it doesn't play like any gatcha I've seen before, the developers have out done themselves with cross save im able to play on the go, (it drains the battery but thats understandable) and come back home and continue the game on my PC",Positive,421,77
Syncer,2020-09-30 01:12:25,"I don't usually leave reviews for games except for a select view, but this game wholely deserves my 5 star rating. The amount of effort that the developers put in that I can see in my first 45mins of gameplay is astounding. In summary, this game is a well polished RPG, optimized looting and combat system that's better than almost any mobile games I've come across. This is one of those few mobile games that deserves your time. Give it a shot.",Positive,445,82
Th3V1p3r,2020-10-11 04:14:54,"A great game. Very relaxing and there are no pay to win microtransactions. Sure, there are some, but there are not giving you any buff. I really want in the future to see more team based content. For example Guilds, a place, where everybody will donate resources and build the base, where you could customize it, a place like ""Dawn Winery"" where everybody hangs out and do stuff together.",Positive,388,69
Raymond Guo,2020-09-29 00:41:44,"Definitely a great JRPG on mobile, taking a few inspirations from BOTW but all for the best.

prince kyaw,2020-10-18 20:32:27,"Love this game with many various creation and game design. Although little FPS drop in wondering around and combat, this game is really great.

Jun 10,2020-09-29 07:24:31,"This game is most likely a 4.6-5 star rated game, in my opinion. The game is immersive and the soundtrack is phenomenal. The graphics are amazing and this is the first game that I have seriously reviewed. For the people reading this most, if not all of the 1 star reviews are complaints on download speeds. However, to clarify, this game just launched and download speeds will get better (I just downloaded it on my phone in under a minute). Also you can also download on other platforms.",Positive,488,88
Marshal,2020-10-02 00:44:15,"This game is such a breath of fresh air on mobiles. It will help dispel some of that bias towards mobile games.

This game is plainly fantastic, and there is no reason you shouldn‚Äôt play it.",Positive,302,57
Cohen,2020-10-02 22:30:36,"If I could, I would give it 6 out of 5 stars, the graphics are beautiful for being a mobile game, the soundtrack is amazing, adding an atmosphere to the experience, and the game balances out the power and abilities of all the characters extremely well, making it so that the 5 stars don't outperform the lower 4 stars by that much. As of what I experienced currently as well, there is basically no paywall. Overall amazing game, if you are a fan of a Zelda like experience this is a must try game.",Positive,497,94

I'm a pc player who picked up the mobile version of the game since your account progress syncs and carries over. Phenomenal. Although it (reasonably) consumes a lot of battery, even on mobile it's stunningly beautiful and the world is just as vast. The controls are not bad either. The story is beautifully told through cinematics and dialog, the former which are absolutely beautifully drawn and animated. Truly a must play for all",Positive,473,80

The sounds are fitting, and the music is quite lovely. The characters look awesome, and the combat is fun. There's NO auto fighting, which I love! There are a few glitches though. The only one I saw was that sometimes items glitch through the map before you pick them up. Also, it says you can play with friends but doesn't tell you how.",Positive,495,92

Rachel Wong,2020-10-03 13:02:02,"It's simply beautiful. Those who love open world gaming would love this game. The gacha system does not influence the game in earlier levels and honestly, it doesn't make too much of a difference unless you're super competitive or want the perfect SS team.

Nu Le,2020-10-07 07:16:23,"Meticulously crafted and lovingly created, the cast has unique characters, even if you don't roll gacha. The controls are a little harder on mobile as opposed to PC (I play both) but that's on account of my own dexterity. Everything is easy to pick up and learn, and the open world is gorgeous. I love climbing mountains and just staring at the scenery",Positive,352,63

While at surface level the game may look pay to win, there is actually more to it and the amount of stuff a free to play player can do is amazing. Just by playing the game you will slowly build up the premium currency and will be able to buy wishes which will get you the 5 star characters and weapons.

Galaxy_6554,2020-10-01 11:56:16,I haven't been playing for a long time but I have about 5 hrs into the game and I think its really fun and the world is really run to explore the urge to spend money in this game is crazy tho. So be careful when playing you dont need the 5 star people (at least not early game) but they do really cool abilities that make you want to buy them. But the game is free to play you dont NEED to spend money to be successful in the game you will just feel more fulfilled if you get the 5 star characters.,Positive,498,104
Alec Lester Reyes,2020-10-18 10:03:16,"Absolute best graphics I've seen for a mobile game. The puzzles and quests are more than enough to hook you in for hours. The content put in to this game is outstanding. Most importantly, it's not a pay-to-win game. Kudos to the developer!",Positive,239,43
Zaur Hasanov,2020-10-03 23:36:26,This is an amazing game! I have never played an open world mobile game with so much to explore. The combat is fun and the system of element interactions is perfect.

There are a lot of npcs telling story where I wish i could help them.

You can clearly see this game was inspired by breath of the wild, but is beautiful and exciting in its own way. The only thing I can say I want to complain about is that the game isn't compatible to be played with the Xbox controller on mobile.

Autistic Muffin Brain Cells Damaged,2020-10-12 09:07:22,Best Mobile game I've ever played. It's like those pc games with good ads and not bad ads. It didn't go through the route of other mobile games and it makes this game unique. Although some lag can occur but the graphics and storyline makes up for it. I won't spoil the storyline of the game if anyone reads this review.

What awesome about it is that there's so many npc interactions that make the world feel alive, it had a wide map as well and many more amazing content. My only problem is with the character switch. Please dont make the reserve character ui to change place everytime im switching character. It kinda confuse me.",Positive,499,90
ZIbusiso Nkomo,2020-10-07 00:43:38,Absolutely love the open world map that frees you up to do just about anything you want to do. The game does have a gacha but as of now it doesn't matter at all which characters you have. It's purely to collect them if you wish to play the gacha. There is plenty to keep you busy and suits those that love to role play and have an itch for exploring every inch of a map (which the game generously rewards you for),Positive,413,83
Shannalea,2020-09-30 20:20:04,"I'm obsessed with this game, it's beautiful, explorative and the devs even being able to get a game like this on mobile is incredible. It's harder to play on mobile during bosses etc and I play pc majority of the time. How they made this in unity I have no idea, I'd happily pay ¬£40-¬£50 for this.

Only from phone to PC. I wanted to play on console when I am home and phone when I am somewhere outside. But that isn't possible unfortunately.

Latifa Mantawil,2020-10-01 16:49:36,"It is an amazing game. It reminds me of zelda breath of the wild. The music is just winds and footsteps, sound of water, where you can climb anywhere. You can do anything. The controls are great, graphics, voice acting of each characters are handled properly. Side missions, hidden quests makes the game not boring since i love to roam and do side quest rather than the main quest. There are so many things to focus like the gears and to choose your main characters.",Positive,466,85
Mikazuki 775,2020-10-08 20:22:13,"Absolutely incredible, I prefer to play on console due to being more comfortable with a controller, but even with that the mobile version is still one of the best games on the platform, graphics you wouldn't think would be possible on mobile with gameplay and mechanics that are fun and easy to pick up, overall an amazing game for anyone with a phone that can run it.",Positive,368,67
Jhercel,2020-10-02 16:41:01,"For a new open world rpg, this game is absolutely the best. you can feel the open world environment as the character can climb, swim, etc. and there are a lot of customization to choose from. thumbs up. genshin impact has a lot of potential and really promising. keep up the good work guys!",Positive,290,54
Lil Dragon,2020-10-04 12:09:26,"Further optimization to make it so that my phone doesn't heat up so much would be highly appreciated. And some sort of controller support to the game would be super cool!!! Only because my hands get a little cramped sometimes keeping them in the same position for an hour or 2 and being able to use a controller would be VERY nice, Im sure others have this problem aswell. Other then that im having a super fun time with this game!!!",Positive,433,81
NOVA 470,2020-09-29 09:39:02,"Such a good game,compared to the other games I play this seems alot more relaxed minus the minor motion sickness, definitely has the appeal requires a few minor bug fixes but the game did just launch so understandable also for a phone game the graphics blew me away its pretty smooth and the climbing feature I am impressed, not many games can keep up with the load time to do that, the flying feature is a smooth piece aswell takes awhile to get used to but works well, keep the features comingüòÄüòÄ",Positive,497,92
Are _ Cool,2020-10-02 09:27:04,"Never thought that a game this amazing is totally free to play. The gacha system is there only to help you progress faster and easier but without it you could play as usual without huge paywall like other gacha games. Huge open world with lots of interactive stuff and different approach to fight minsters makes it really hard to get bored. Great Voice acting, story and lore makes it much more interesting. Overall, anyone whi loves rpg games should try this out.",Positive,464,82
Kei Lebron,2020-11-06 17:35:25,"I love this game. I'm reviewing budget phone that can play this look for ""clowread tech"" on youtube.",Positive,100,18
Diago Martins,2020-09-29 06:14:09,"Amazing game and graphics Gameplay a little like zelda! Finding chests, loot, solving puzzles to defeating enemies, for a long time I've looked for a game with all of this so happy! Literally lost track of time playing highly addictive as it makes you want to progress further find more and discover more! Would highly recommend if you enjoy a good rpg it is not pay to win wich worried me! But characters game offers are brilliant each with unique fighting styles and distances such good fun!",Positive,493,87
Mohamma Shahzaib,2020-10-01 06:34:14,"I've played a lot of games on the app store, but none of them can be compared to this game. This game is way too good to be on a phone. I'm so glad they did make this game. I just hope they add more GUYS in this game cuz there are more girls in this game than guys as playable characters but i'm okay with just my main character (strongest in the game i swear) and kaeya but more would be nice. Btw this game is not pay 2 play, its completely optional and it doesnt force you into buying anything",Positive,496,102
Macy Davis,2020-10-11 01:38:59,"It's been a lot of fun to just go off exploring, and when I finally get around to the main plot it's fun to see where the story goes. My only problem is that since I can only play on mobile, my battery is drained pretty quickly. Even if I'm playing on the lowest graphic setting. Ah well, big map, lots of data",Positive,310,63
Mittal Chauhan,2020-10-28 19:36:55,"Game have exceptional graphics, free roaming open world. Didn't expected this in mobile game almost similar to zelda franchise.",Positive,127,19
Hossain Shamil,2020-09-28 19:27:13,"Most possibly the best mobile game I've came across. Amazing storyline with wonderful graphics. The voice acting is as good as it can get. Smooth controls, fabulous gameplay and likable characters with good character design. Even the storytelling is interesting and keeps you engaged. Overall loved the experience.",Positive,314,48
Dan D Lion,2020-09-28 19:30:16,"I've been waiting this game for so long and I really love it. Played non stop since the release. It might be because my device barely supports the good graphics that it crashed several times on one point in the game, nevertheless, I'd like it to give it a 5 star since I've been having so much fun lately.",Positive,305,59
Joe Chen,2020-09-29 00:46:48,"Controls are a bit wonky on mobile. I have to reach my left thumb quite a bit to shift to a faster walk. I would love a control scheme change option in the setting to place buttons where you are most comfortable, or scale things to size. Also, I think sometimes my Bluetooth earbuds do something to the game to make the audio a bit staticy, but it could just be me. Amazing graphics and a lovely story. Give it a try! It may be your new favorite adventure game!",Positive,461,90
Meimei Fan,2020-09-29 11:52:37,"This is seriously a good game for me. I can get distracted easily, since there are lots of other things to do than the main quest. The characters are loveable and the scenery are spectacular. Haven't gotten any lag spikes and I get to lower the resolution or heighten the resolution to whatever I want. Controlling the characters and fighting monsters is quite smooth.",Positive,368,64
Jaco Collins,2020-10-01 22:21:04,"I am completely amazed by the gorgeous looking graphics of the game, I often find myself just wandering around looking at the details of the water, the mountains and the sun light, and the gameplay is really cool too! Oh and don't sleep on the story of the game in general is pretty interesting, but what I love the most about this game is the fact that the developers of the game didn't implement the simplistic yet annoying auto movement and auto fighting, love the game!!.",Positive,475,86
SaRoJ Rai,2020-10-30 23:55:49,It's the best role playing game I have ever played since last 2 year I guess. Just the world where it doesn't need to go to loading screen when you go different region where game of the game have this and it annoys me but this game have everything I wanted for mobile.,Positive,268,53
Yee Yy,2020-10-03 16:14:12,"This game is legit! I enjoyed the gameplay and also the story line. Each character is unique on their own but I wouldn't say every character or hero is useful. The only thing now is could Mihoyo give us a mount? I know that you can teleport from place to place but seriously the walking part is just so time consuming and it gets annoying sometimes... anyway, this is a game that everyone should give it a try!",Positive,410,78
Jeruel Pajarillo,2020-10-12 21:16:41,"This just changed the game in mobile gaming. GI proved that you can have a huge open world game that you can play anywhere not to mention the cross-play factor. Also, this proved that people love games more that doesn't have an auto mode where everything is done for you in a single click. It feels more rewarding to see your characters grow from the result of your hard work. The gorgeous graphics is a big factor as well. Small things like climbing & gliding also adds to the quality of it.",Positive,492,92
Alex Turcios,2020-10-10 07:33:54,This game is fantastic for being a mobile game. I was wondering if this game could be played with a controller just to make it funner and more easy to control. I like it a lot hopefully in a future update it can be possible. If you guy's can could you add to make it play with a controller like for example a playstation and xbox controller.,Positive,341,67
Aiko Tajima,2020-10-09 00:44:21,I'm having way too much fun playing this game. I love the cute characters and the graphics and gameplay are pretty great and the stories are easy to follow along and the voice acting is really good too. I feel like I'm playing a nostalgic game but it's just super good. I hope there's more cool stuff on GI's way soon. Thanks!!,Positive,327,62
Bing Bong,2020-10-10 15:19:29,"This game totally breaks my expectations for a mobile game. Like this is a 60 console title quality game. You could play it for hours without paying a dime. But I highly suggest you do because its clear alot of hard work and care went into this game. Don't let the anime vibe fool you, the game play is amazing!",Positive,311,60

tadalori,2020-10-02 20:04:53,"This is one of the Best RPG I've ever played. I love playing RPG games, and this is what I've been wanting to play, the graphics are amazing, good characters and great mechanics. It gets hard for me to get off while playing since it's so entertaining. And the voice actors are doing a good job, and the soundtrack, don't get me started on the soundtrack. It's so good. The only thing that bothers me is how my CPU gets really hot only after a few minutes. And how my battery gets drained.",Positive,488,93
overjoy,2020-10-04 08:12:56,"BEST GAME 9/10 would play, it's even trending in social media right now. Graphics are very good but heavy for most phones, please optimize. I have a problem entering the game though. When I log in and enter, I get stuck at the loading screen, it loads up until the last symbol and stops. Tried restarting many times but won't work. Please fix this issue.",Positive,354,65
Abasi Tucker,2020-10-08 05:47:21,"This is a solid example of a fun exploration game. The elemental combat interactions are great and enemies get more complex with time. My only complaint is the speed at which one unlocks the map is lower than my desire, but it may be protection from wandering into instant death this early in the game.",Positive,302,55
Joseph Memmelaar,2020-10-06 05:02:29,Awesome Gacha game that is fair. The game plays very much like a single player experience and is a lot of fun. There is a mobile/pc cross save so make sure to check it out on pc as well. New players starting at the time of this review get 40 summons which allows you to get several characters to try out.,Positive,304,61
Ren Andrade,2020-10-07 12:43:14,"This game is gorgeous in every aspect. The characters are adorable, the missions are fair to f2p players and simply exploring the world is already an amazing experience. I'm excited for new updates on the map and what the story will bring us in the future. It's certainly my favourite game now!",Positive,294,52
Jayvees,2020-10-04 07:42:11,Awesome 3d game that you can't stop on! Because once you play this game there's no turning back. It's 3d element of the game especially you play either PC or Mobile version is mesmerising. Not just that but the characters in the game is beautiful and you can play as one character out of four for your first-team. And also it has multiplayer too if you want to have fun with people. So overall this game is super recommended to play and over 1 (or more) million downloads says it all.,Positive,484,91
ÈæçSmiff,2020-10-16 06:32:00,"Probably the best open world MMO RPG mobile devices have seen in a long time. Beautiful graphics, highly addicting storyline and world exploration. A decent gacha system and AMAZING music. The only bug I have to report that is slightly annoying is monsters than can jump or leap then slam the ground seem to disapear a lot of time and the only fix is to move around/ shake your camera screen a bunch until the entity re-appears.",Positive,428,77
L33TSO,2020-10-06 14:30:32,"It's amazing how well this runs on mobile. The graphics are simply put, some of the best out there. The story is very intriguing and I can't wait to get deeper into it. The gameplay is great! The way all the elements work off one another is something I have never seen before in a game, let alone a mobile game. The controls are good, they're easy to get used to, and well spaced and placed. I only wish there was controller support on mobile. Great game either way. 100% recommended.",Positive,484,91
Metsivikho,2020-10-03 22:08:51,So far the best game I've played in mobile. The graphic is breathtaking....but I have an issue with switching server and the control layout.... please enable control layout edit option and switch server without any issues... that's what I would recommend to change or add...but so far the best game ever.... thanks for the game.,Positive,328,55
Daeny,2020-10-05 00:42:18,"I really love this game a lot but the only issue I have is the lag and freezing issues on Android, I have a fast and stable internet but the game lags whenever I enter combat or simply going to where I need to go to complete quests, I would really love to play more if there wasn't any lag. I hope you can fix this to make it more enjoyable to play.",Positive,349,73
Thanh Hai Vu,2020-10-13 12:42:41,"This is so far the best game I ever played on android. Graphics are amazing with an incredible level of details in everything.

Overall, this game made me speechless.üî•",Positive,332,56
Yllan Creencia,2020-09-28 17:38:15,Waiting this game for a long time. For others that doesn't have meet the requirement or if your device is a potato don't bother. I am not discrediting your devices but for a gorgeous game like this you need at least understand the minimum requirement to run this game smoothly. Have patience for the others who are still downloading coz the game is still not open yet. The devs give us time to prepare. Just enjoy the game and have some fun.,Positive,441,82
Luke Kelly,2020-10-03 12:51:59,Ok I have decided to continue installing the game as there just aren't many good games for Android. Running on an Exynos S8 the game has stuttering and freezing issues during cinematics and sometimes when attacking. The game takes the graphics of Zelda Breath of the Wild and the character story of World of Final Fantasy and the fighting aesthetic of Nier Automata. It is a fantastic game overall. Great game to use with a controller. I don't recommend it with just a touch screen.,Positive,482,85
little Sea Creature,2020-09-30 13:24:04,"10/10 game I am just amazed by the quality for a mobile game, the characters are well designed, the world beautiful, top notch voice acting , pretty music, great fighting mechanics and amazing story. All around a great game. Even thoughi keep my game in low graphics the graphics are still amazing.I can see myself spending hours playing it. I highly recommend playing it :))))))))",Positive,381,65
Esuna,2020-10-14 10:31:56,"Update from my last review, as of now this game is just great, massive open world experience with some puzzles during exploration and reasonable rewards i guess, some downsides are the cost of resin when doing domains and bosses, would be better if u can adjust it or increase the max limit of the player's resin, and i hope the map expands and the main quest continues. The gacha, well its ok for now at least. So overall experience is just too good",Positive,450,83
Marco Arienzo,2020-10-04 08:24:18,"This game is seriously amazing. Cross platform allows me to log onto my pc and continue playing when I want. As long as you don't mind the gacha element, it's a terrific, free l, open world, Zelda BoTW style adventure with a great story and plenty of viable free characters you unlock. Best mobile game to date in my opinion.",Positive,325,60
Jared Gillam,2020-10-03 12:50:38,"For a game that has just come out for free on most platforms that has no p2w features evident, this game is phenominal. The graphics, music, story, and optimization are unreal. Having played on PC as well I was floored to find that mobile handles as smoothly. This game continues to surpass my expectations at every turn. Well done devs, this is an incredible game!",Positive,365,65
Aathithya Ananth,2020-10-27 23:01:25,The best realistic game I ever played in my life except for the monsters the whole world is perfect the graphics are so good interesting missions. There is a resource pack download after u download which takes a long time so if you have limited data just a warning.,Positive,265,49
Ravine Reedy,2020-10-03 15:33:43,"This is one of the most refreshing games I have every played. It takes everything I love about my favorite fantasy animes and brings the genre to life. The graphics are stunning, story is amazing, and gameplay is smooth across mobile and PC... I cant beilieve this isnt a $60 title, I would gladly pay that price, even for the mobile version.",Positive,342,62
Ryan Escherich,2020-09-29 10:51:19,"You guys promised an open world RPG, and from what I've seen, you delivered. The game is amazing, the graphics are breathtaking, and you even made the environmental hazards fairly realistic. Downside, though, is the slow connection at times. I'll be running or walking and then suddenly, I'm not anymore. Or I'll be attacking something and go to use a heavy attack...only to have it not happen at all because of the lag. You guys just need to streamline the connection a bit more.",Positive,480,84
RazeCrown Solus,2020-10-05 00:06:09,"Amazing game, really bought back memories of games i used to play on consoles. Amazing world. The combat mechanics are fun and you always want to keep going. Love the work done in this game, hope for more such contents in the future. Though i have some concerns, my game , whenever movie cutscenes are there, freezes completely. This also occured on the lowest settting as well. Others are animations are smooth, with no problems. Dev team, Please inform me what i am supposed to do to fix this",Positive,494,89
Joshua Dimwitt,2020-09-29 08:55:18,So this game is Breath of the Wild with more of an anime touch. The game feels like a huge open world single player game with light sprinkle of gacha elements that never really break the game for me. The graphics and gameplay seem amazing and everything feels very well put together. Since its free I'd definitely recommend giving it a chance.,Positive,343,62
Bal√°zs Krab√≥t,2020-10-19 16:57:19,"Best game ever made: no auto attack, no auto find, nothing annoying, beautiful graphics, large map to discover. The perfect game. After playing at your pc the whole day, u can go and play with it on your phone in the bed. Just perfect.",Positive,235,44
Zeeshan 0545,2020-10-04 14:13:03,"(GAME OF THE YEAR)First time i am writing a review for a game on playstore. This game is probably the best game on mobile for far. It comes with such an amazing open world and also allows the player to interact with various objects in the open world. It has such great story line. The graphics are out standing, feels like you are playing on ps5. I simply don't have enough words to write about this game. Don't think twice and download it now!",Positive,444,84
Playing Games,2020-10-05 06:00:05,THANK YOU MIHOYO for creating this game! The graphic is superb! I love how not only the main character have his/her voice but the side character also have their own voice even random stranger that I met at the open world map too. It makes me enjoy the story line more and also Paimon is so funny lol. I also love the fact that this game focus on single player since I've played DR before but I felt lonely in that game since it focuses more on multiplayer and I prefer to play solo lol.,Positive,486,95
Trina Fernandez,2020-10-07 23:59:24,"Very beautifully crafted game with absolutely charming characters and an immersive open world experience. Climbing and gliding is a definite game changer. Interesting plots and subtle humorous dialogues. Great combat gameplay and very pleasant ambience. So much to discover, I can't believe this is free. I look forward to multi-player with friends! Thank you for often giving away free characters. I love how you prioritize user experience with your surveys to improve the game! Highly recommended!",Positive,499,76
Jason Portante,2020-10-04 12:55:50,"The game is phenomenal. an absolute must play. the graphics bare stunning, the gameplay is mostly fantastic(no target lock is a bit irritating). the spell effects and the different combinations of elemental magics combining is gorgeous. the story is great, the music is great. only play this knowing you won't get good rolls or it will ruin your experience. play with what you get because it's fun. the abysmal 0.06% chance to get the best characters is a total joke and will make you really mad.",Positive,496,86
Aditya Duel,2020-09-29 04:56:19,"It's so good..graphics, visual effects and the exploration with secret treasures, different monsters with different types and bosses & dungeons...everything is awesome.

Rex W,2020-10-02 23:00:19,"This gaming is absolutely amazing. I was blown away on how good the sotryline, graphic, style and all mechanics in the game. Gamers can easily spend money in this game because everything is reasonable without breaking the bank. There are minor issues, like others have mentioned, control (climbing on wall or over railings on the building when not intended) and camera view (objects blocking the view or sudden change of direction at times) - just some simple touch-ups will make this game perfect!",Positive,498,83
Captain Carra,2020-10-10 18:15:13,"This is a game i could sink a LOT of time into. The game mechanics themselves are plucked straight from Zelda BotW buuuut that makes it all the more enjoyable as it plays beautifully with strong graphic quality, good narrative, beautifully designed characters and a map as expansive as BotW but not at all slow (you can traverse the map fairly easily with use of the teleport nodes dotted around the world).",Positive,407,72
Trac Nguyen,2020-10-04 17:07:44,"First immersive RPG that i have ever played on my phone. The game mechanics are well designed. The graphic is stunning. Traveling feels smooth. It reminds me of Kingdoms of Amalur. However this type of free form traveling can sometime be a bit frustrating on a mobile UI due to it being hard to control your character to move around. Overall, amazing game, especially one that is multi-platform with mobile included.",Positive,416,71
Alan Shvartsberg,2020-09-30 21:39:24,Not your typical mobile game definitely tired of the re skin money grabs on the market this is a breath of fresh air with no auto play. I play this on mobile on the go and play on my PC at home. Has a great story characters and certain weapons are gated by gacha but you don't need them to win the game their more for personal preference you can get cash and be f2p. Would definitely recommend this game,Positive,403,80
MzCat,2020-09-30 10:11:21,"Really well done. I'm playing on a Samsung Tab S4 with a 4 GB ram. Only had problems when downloading and the first two days after release (with my screen freezing during cut scenes). It's been great since, though. No crashes so far. People who had issues on the release date, do try again. Beautiful game, terrific soundtrack, reasonable subscription price. Love it!",Positive,367,63
Andrew Dunn,2020-09-29 03:44:33,"This game is excellent. I've just started but the free roaming, elemental combination battle tactics, and multiple characters to choose from make this a very interactive and fun game. Keep up the good work guys. Also like that there is no autoplay... you're not even playing a game then.",Positive,287,49
Victoria DeVelbiss,2020-10-05 05:00:59,"This game is AMAZING!!!! I only found it yesterday, and it took HOURS to download, but it is SOOOOO worth it! The graphics are incredible for an RPG like this on a phone, but it sucks up phone battery like no body's business. The controls are very user friendly and not overwhelming, though it does take some coordination. To me it seems like a kind of LoZ BotW/Skyrim/Sao hybrid in the best ways.",Positive,397,73
State Stefan-Cosmin,2020-10-13 01:33:34,"This is the best game in his class. Superb graphics and gameplay. I really enjoy that you can't skip cinematics and dialogues as it keeps you connected with the story. Cinematics are awesome and i really like the fact that the game and cinematics are matching not like other games where you see a great movie as cinematics and awful graphics. NO, not the case here. Great job for the developersüëåüëå",Positive,396,71

Brenton Franklin,2020-09-28 20:32:20,"I have to admit it, I'm impressed. A Gacha game that doesn't force the mechanic down your throat. Is this game a BoTW clone? Only when it comes to the movement mechanics. Combat is where this game shines and sets itself apart. Switching characters to string together elemental combos feels fluid and works solidly, though on mobile it can feel a little clunky depending on your screen size. Despite that this game is simply amazing. I can't wait for the Switch release.",Positive,469,82
Zaitoshi,2020-10-08 20:34:10,The game is really incredible by far this is thr best RPG I've ever played. Though I was looking forward to creating guilds and all but it's fine even without such functions. The game also has amazing graphics despite having it set on the lowest quality. Is it also possible to be able to play Co-op with people on different servers atleast when we're friends with them in the future? Thank you for making such a wonderful game!,Positive,428,78
Eternal Silence,2020-09-29 23:25:45,"It's been a long time since I wanted to play a game. Genshin Impact is a AAA gaming experience that requires powerful hardware. It gives off the vibe of being isekaied and having to figure out what to do and what you want to do in a new strange world on your own. There were many surprises that brought a huge smile to my face and I expect there will be more, like when I accidentally climbed trees for the first time. Idk what people r saying about connectivity issues; it worked perfectly for me.",Positive,498,95
A Google user,2020-10-07 15:42:38,"I love this game! The graphics are beautiful and the story is engaging. I have encountered a problem though which I think is a glitch and I'm wondering if you can help. I sent a character out on an expedition for the first time then claimed the reward but the character has not returned to my party, how do I get her back?",Positive,322,63
Han Pham,2020-10-17 09:25:05,"I'm giving this game a 5 star because I really think this is a beautiful and amazing game. I would definitely rate it as my top 5 best games to play. However, with many great games, there are downfall. One of the biggest downfall about this game is that the resin system can drastically be improved. The amount of resin you need is insane. One solution would be to increase the amount of max resin or decrease the amount of resin you need to spend to unlock materials.",Positive,468,88
Ciruya,2020-10-02 17:42:54,"This is an actual game that just so happens to be playable on your phone. It's everything you could want in a gacha game AND in a triple A action/adventure game. And that's all at launch. Super excited to see all the future content that only improves this magnificent experience, some of it announced week one.",Positive,310,56
Randell Edward Menor,2020-10-02 18:52:25,"Surprisingly good but there is one giant flaw in the game that must be addressed immediately, you cant pet the dog in town. Ruined the game for me... But in all seriousness, its a great game. Although pricing and the success rate in the lootbox style store could be better. Shop price is a bit too steep for my wallet, tho im poor to begin with.",Positive,345,66
Zor John Ylosorio,2020-10-10 00:46:12,"Great game and good graphics for a mobile game. Quite big but worth it. My only problem is my game crashing, I would for about 1hr and then crash mid-game. Need to restart my phone to fix but keeps coming back. I have the minium requirements to play and the graphics is lowest possible. Idk what us happening but please fix it.",Positive,327,62
Jonathan Fawzi,2020-09-28 11:49:24,"This is the best game I've played on mobile by a considerable margin. Visually the game is stunning, and the gameplay is akin to a console quality RPG with an interesting anime-inspired story, plus it actually has surprisingly great voice acting too. Only thing Genshin is missing is controller support for mobile which is already available for PC and PS4, so hopefully they can add this in the future. I can already tell im going to be playing this non-stop for the next few months",Positive,482,85
Sidney pal,2020-10-02 22:12:49,"Though it has some bugs, It did come out last week, it's an amazing story, I found myself tearing up at the end of chapter 1, the bittersweet ending and saying goodbye to friends made me emotional. If the story doesn't get you, the graphics will. They are AMAZING! I've taken so many pictures. When I saw this game I thought it was to good to be true, but it's everything I hoped for a mobile rpg. It's really large and takes a long time to download and install, but it's 100% worth it.",Positive,486,94
Nicasio Cintron,2020-10-01 03:57:48,"I would say for a note 10 5g, this game eats my battery on moderate(mid) settings for graphics. That said, it is a great mobile game that gives that feel they were going for. Sadly micro transactions, but the characters are very unique and the game play is smooth. My concern is lack of things in the environment to do and replay value after you've beaten the story. I really would love for it to have better battery controls besides downgrading quality, possible offline play.",Positive,477,85
35 Gala Harsh,2020-10-01 00:06:03,"I started playing this game 2 days ago, and I gotta say, I'm hooked! I feel like a lot of people disregarded the game due to its size and im not blaming them for that, because lots of people may not have access to enough intenet speeds to download such a huge file. But if you have the opportunity to download this game I'd usher u to do so. Its an amazing game and I loved it",Positive,376,77
Navneet Das Pranto,2020-10-13 15:58:05,Didn't expect it to be that good at the start but the more I played the more I have fallen in love with this game.... The story telling the animation all are over the top... And if u have a good mobile then the graphics is out of this world.... I mean for a mobile phone this is truly amazing...,Positive,295,60
Kenneth Crowell,2020-10-08 22:41:10,"This game is very enjoyable. It's deep, fun and immersive. It's controls can be frustrating at times along with the occasional confusing quests. But overall, I highly recommend this to anyone that likes and appreciates adventure games. By the way, graphically, it's too notch.",Positive,276,44
Kaizaki Arata,2020-10-07 13:10:41,"The controls on the phone ed prefer it to be more customisable as some skills are hard to press when youre moving and attacking. This causes a huge window for monsters to land deadly blows. There's problem with the dash too ,sometimes when pressing dash button ,it sometimes doesnt follow the movement direction and causing to either fall of a cliff or avvidentally fall in crossfire.",Positive,384,66
„Ç∏„É£„Ç§„Éî„Éº,2020-10-01 12:36:45,"New to this game, and I freaking loving it, the graphics, gameplay, and the controls are freaking amazing! Its really a fascinating Top Tier Game on mobile, its sad that its low on weapons, can I suggest to add more weapons and my favorite weapon a scythe, its fine if you wont add some, but still this will keep remaining 5Star!",Positive,329,61
John Philip Noriega,2020-10-03 17:36:31,"Have tried playing a of open-world RPG games, but this game just simply surpasses them. Gameplay is awesome, Iand more importantly IAPs are almost optional (at least for now). The only gripe I have with this game is the lack of PvP. But overall, it was worth the time I waited for the download.",Positive,294,54
Alice Alexander,2020-10-03 20:04:25,"I cannot believe how good this is. It's visually gorgeous, the gameplay is tight, and the music is straight up serotonin delivery. I mainly play on my PC but hop on my phone when I get sleepy. It runs very nicely at ~60 fps with no overheating on my S10. I've also heard great things about the developers so I look forward to what they have in store for this game.",Positive,364,71
Oversized Enigma,2020-10-08 07:13:28,"I was really impressed at how big this game is, I love playing rpgs and the co-op system seems so refreshing, 'cause I thought this game was a MMORPG. I love how you can interact with the world with puzzles and looting materials, crafting and even cooking!. This game is real good.",Positive,281,52
Harley Da Silva Dujardin,2020-10-02 05:37:28,This is the game I've been waiting for it's a beautiful mix of breath of the wild with an robust fighting and exploring mechanism. Playing it feels like you're playing a triple A game on a phone. Because of this game I have hope for the future of mobile gaming as a serious alternative to console or PC gaming.,Positive,310,59
Harsh S.,2020-10-09 23:24:18,"So I noticed the game from the YouTube ads and then one of my friend tried it out and recommended to me so I tried it out and , it is an amazing game the gameplay makes me forget that this is a gatcha game, great graphics , amazing gameplay loved that you can play on pc and mobile with the same account, sadly I can't play on PS4 with the same account really wanted the wings in my main account.",Positive,396,81
Dominique Mesich,2020-10-06 07:22:34,"Feels like playing the breath of the wild but with choices of characters. Imo it is enjoyable and got hooked pretty badly thats for sure! Lol all in all it is an action rpg with a big world to explore and more regions to come as the gintrusive. The graphics and art style feels amazing and it doesn't feel like a mobile game at all. I would recommend this game if people like this sort of game. I don't mind the ""gotcha"" aspect and the game doesn't feel intrsuive.",Positive,464,89
Aqasya Azmi,2020-10-03 02:05:24,This game caught me by surprise. They really did a great job this time on the gameplay and the graphics but the graphics is actually not good for me because my phone don't really have high RAM. The controls for this game is also good and friendly which makes the gameplay a lot more fun. You also can get easily sidetracked when doing quests which proves that this game has a lot more fun features other than doing the story. Thanks for making this game mihoyo.,Positive,461,86
Kristine,2020-09-29 16:49:53,"STUNNING üòç I've played F2P anime and SEA games for the past 15 years and nothing compares. For me the ""play along story element"" surpasses Elder Scrolls and WoW. I am considering canceling my ESO subscription to dedicate to playing this game if they continue to add phenomenal content like they have for the initial release. This developer knows what they are doing. After 15 years of F2P P2W I can understand why some people don't give this game a deeper look. 100% reccomend Genshin Impact.",Positive,492,86
Matthew Lewis-thorne,2020-10-01 10:38:05,"First and foremost this is a gotcha game that you dont have to play as a gotcha game, if you want to take the game serious you either need some staggering luck at the beginning or drop some money. but if u just want a interesting game that looks fantastic and has a decent story there's no need to drop a dime.",Positive,310,62
Sebastien James,2020-11-11 07:55:27,"Honestly, the game is amazing. Great visually, good story, interesting combat mechanics...",Positive,90,12
demonic pyro,2020-10-09 09:09:58,"Phenomenal game play, really like how its an open world RPG. And it wasn't done all sloppy, I'm actually amazed on how smooth it runs on a phone, this seems more like a PC or console. I have never played a better open world RPG on my phone yet. And I don't think I will for quite a while.",Positive,288,59
PantsAdvance,2020-10-02 07:37:59,"Its got an interesting story with easy to use game mechanics. The visuals are beautiful and smooth. However it drains battery like crazy and you will want to make sure you have a light and airy phone case to prevent from overheating. Also, don't forget to restart your phone after you install to refresh memory just like with any other app.",Positive,340,61
Joshua De S,2020-10-05 04:21:27,"I never do ratings but this game is actually incredible. cross play with friends on pc is amazing and because it saves in the cloud, I play on my phone on the go, laptop when I'm at home. when I tell you the graphics are actually real, it blew my mind away how perfectly, exactly like Zelda this game is. So much to do, im super excited to discover the open world and do all the missions and daily stuff. COMPLETELY FREE and Truly do not need to buy anything!!",Positive,460,90
PILLAR,2020-10-08 22:52:45,"This game is completely F2P friendly, you DON'T NEED those 5 stars you WANT them. Don't listen to the PC tripleA elitists that dropped it for being a gacha its a mobile game after all. This game will have content for years, possibly 5-10 years worth of playtime (hopefully) which most 60$ PC game would fall off after a month. The game is aesthetically pleasing and the OST is splendid. Support mihoyo so they can keep bringing us games like HI3 and Genshin.",Positive,458,83
Remeindre Kasane,2020-09-30 04:01:31,"I am very pleased with my experience thus far. High points for me: -The gamplay is fun, in particular exploring and combat. -The aesthetic is beautiful. -The story premise is promising. (minor) Low points for me: -There are occasionally moments of lag, but I am not sure if it is the game's fault. -The ""joystick"" control is fixed in place, unlike other games where the joystick centers on where my thumb or finger initially touches the screen. It is not bad, but takes getting used to.",Positive,486,86
Roderick Datoc,2020-10-13 23:35:42,Game plays well so far. Gameplay is smooth. Only nit picks is you can kind of get stuck between the ladder and a hilichurl tower. And mitachachurl with wooden sheilds can sometimes knock you flying into space to areas of the map not explored and flying endlessly through the sky way above the in game sky. Good thing teleport can be done in the air.,Positive,349,65
Diego Smalman,2020-10-16 12:19:38,"Great game, terrific combat, beautiful views, graphics and effects, but the co op is honestly....garbage, like why does it have to be so limiting, why not make it as if you're playing in single player but obviously with your friends, i really hope you can change this or just add more thongs to do in co op.",Positive,307,57
Gal Kel,2020-09-29 14:48:11,Amazing depth and deceptably simple features. The learning curve is great and is sure to be a classic especially among the mobile space. There so many ways to play and paths to take theres something her for everyone. Especially for free but i highly recommend giving the game a chance or showing the devs our appreciation with the crazy good deals in the monthly exclusive store purchases,Positive,388,67
Mr. Ben,2020-10-08 12:56:39,I can't believe how this game is free. I mean the graphics are A+++ and the story is great too. They also have voice overs which I didn't expect. Even without playing the story I can see myself spending hours just exploring the open world.Over all really great game if you have a good device to play it on,Positive,305,59
Lowgun Hendrie,2020-10-08 17:59:56,"This game is perfect if you are a fan of Breath Of the wild, JRPGs, or even just exploration games. Its insane the amount of quality they packed into a mobile game. A beautiful full open world RPG available in your pocket. Your progression will eventually be throttled by your Adventure Rank, which you will mostly level up by daily missions. But it's not really necessary to pay for it if you pace yourself in the game. You can get the full experience of this game for free.",Positive,475,88
Gacha Life Uploads,2020-10-20 22:27:37,"Okay so uh it's a great game, like a really great game. The only problem might be the game and/or my device, but sometimes it freezes and I gotta wait like 30 seconds. But it might be my Phone I don't know. Anyways great game!",Positive,226,45
Mark Vang,2020-10-13 05:21:40,"Made me squirt on my dog by accident; its THAT phenomenal. Far exceeded my expectations, characters are well written and voice acting and dialog is great as well as hilarious at times. Sucked me in harder than the woman around the corner. Gonna need to download this for PC so I can fully immerse myself into the open-world and campaign. Hands down phenomenal.",Positive,360,63
Programming Pleb,2020-10-03 18:06:33,"This game shows very promising potential. As the game has very good graphics, in tandem with an open-world adventure system, it is no doubt the best adventure game I have played so far. That being said, you would need to have a good device to play this game as there is a lot of stuff being rendered in for such a small device. Playing with even with the lowest graphics settings, it is fascinating to see that this game never fails to show give a good gameplay experience.",Positive,473,88
Summer,2020-10-07 00:16:14,"This game is fantastic! I was already playing Honkai Impact 3rd and was wishing they could make a full on open world game. And then it happened! The story is amazing, the characters are so unique, and there's so many things you can do on the world! Everything is interactive! There's not even any ads!! This is one of the best games I've ever played. Keep on doing what you do best, MiHoYo!",Positive,390,73
Kellen Craffey,2020-09-28 20:03:04,This game is amazing love the controls and the world wide adventure. There is only one thing I would like for this is that instead of switching characters let them all fight together instead of switching characters you can also switch while all of your character fight. But in general this game is an amazing.,Positive,309,55
Danielle Vidal,2020-10-03 16:10:03,"A gorgeous game with fantastic gameplay, in essence very LoZ: BotW but with its own charm to stand strong on its own. However, there are some flaws. While controls are mostly fine on mobile, aiming and certain movements can be difficult. Also, there is a gacha system, so it's RNG-heavy... and the rates are very poor. But it's PvE oriented, so if you can handle it, it's worth it to play and build up your team over time as you explore the stunning world.",Positive,456,84
The Box Blaster,2020-10-04 11:49:53,"Sorting out the technical issues, I cannot help but to 5 star this title. There are very few and far between gacha that focus on being a real game first, and gacha second. This is perhaps the greatest example of them all. The exploration and combat depth are great, and raising characters is very satisfying. The rates on the gacha are poor, but to casually play, I have not felt gated at all without paying a dime. And cross play games are always welcome!",Positive,456,84
Robert Davison,2020-11-04 02:58:21,"Perfect (almost) If they could tweak the controls to help resize for tablets, it'd be the perfect game.",Positive,103,18
Xander Vince Olivera,2020-09-28 13:58:55,"I really love the game and I've been waiting for this to be released since it was announced. Too bad I didn't get to play CBT, but at least now I can play to the fullest. Gameplay is good, adventure is fun, and the gacha is cool. They do give anime feels so I've set my game into Japanese voice and they're all cute and cool when I hear them. I look forward for more content!",Positive,375,76
Dusty Torchlight,2020-10-22 11:43:45,"I love this game, it's a great way to pass the time and it has some beautiful scenery, storyline and awesome skills to show off! My only wish so far is for my character to be able to speak too, but overall a very entertaining game!",Positive,231,46
Jorge Romero,2020-10-01 09:15:14,"So far I've been playing for over 3 days and I already fell in love with the playstyle, the storyline and the way its open world. Seriously big props to the developers for putting effort into a game for mobile that feels like your playing on a Nintendo switch. I like the controls because they're smooth just like the graphics and there is so much to do in this game it's hard to get bored. Highly recommend it",Positive,410,78
Markell Taylor,2020-09-28 19:49:24,"Really beautiful game with interesting combat, its like if Breath of the wild was an action rpg, and its very clear that that's what they were going for, so if you liked Breath of the wild this will probably be your cup of tea. For a free to play game its rather huge and might be the most ambitious mobile game I've seen.",Positive,322,63
Yosua Nicolaus,2020-10-10 07:26:17,"Man, this game is freakin' amazing. The world & OSTs is AMAZING. I know it's just a copy of Zelda's Breath of the Wild, but still, man, this game is FREE TO PLAY. The game didn't even force you to use gacha, and we can continue the story normally without using it. I can't believe this game is free, seriously. The only thing that's keeping me from total enjoyment, is the lag graphics I sometimes encounter; well, that's because my phone is a potato. In summary, WE DON'T DESERVE THIS AMAZING GAME.",Positive,499,92
languizard Plays,2020-10-12 10:58:17,The game is very good but there only one problem that is resins. There are so many content in the game but it is blocked by a massive wall called resins it makes the game slower and ruining the fun of the game the resins system need a major work. Like increase of resin by your adventure rank. Or like farmables in the world like anemoculus and gemoculus,Positive,354,68
Helminth Daddy,2020-10-11 05:16:18,"I'll be honest, I used to think that they just hyped it up and it's not really that great.

Manish Singh,2020-10-17 01:11:28,Hands down the best game on mobile devices right now. I just love the fact that I can play it on PC then can continue the same game at mobile when I'm at bed. Runs very smoothly no issues at all but you're gonna need a good phone as well to truly enjoy it. Game is very beautiful and the characters are unique and lovable. A highly recommended game for all rpg fans out there.,Positive,376,75
Roger Rutten,2020-10-17 06:26:14,"Amazing experience for free, and to continue on PC. I have been playing this game for the past week and spent maybe 8 hours on PC and about 2 hours on my phone. I read some negative reviews be sure of the grind at higher levels or the pay to win (pay to progress) mechanics but I have yet to experience this. And if a free game can entertain me for more then 20 hours then I will love it.",Positive,388,80
Ryan McDougall,2020-09-29 14:35:17,"Unbelievably well polished, and far more like a single player story RPG than any gacha game. Genshin Impact has possibly the best combat system I've ever seen in an MMORPG and the art style and music compliment everything beautifully. Some of the characters are a little annoying if you're not I to gacha games but not enough to detract from an otherwise unbelievably well constructed game!",Positive,390,66
TheHunter OfD3vils,2020-10-06 09:17:34,"Definitely one of the best games out there with the graphics on par with pc games and game mechanics that's easy to get used to, been loving it even though I didn't really had much time to play it.

Dawson Navarro,2020-10-12 06:32:09,"The graphics are unfathomably good. I don't know what kind of black magic they casted to make it look great (even on lowest settings), and run smoothly on a *phone*. Gameplay is fun, and works well on mobile. Reminds me of Breath of the Wild mixed with Xenoblade Chronicles. Music is beautiful. Character design is cool. The English voice overs are well done. Only complaint I can think of is the joysticks can't be moved, which is very minor.",Positive,443,79
Daniel Thomas,2020-09-29 12:47:01,"So far I'm really loving this game. I would go so far as to say its completely different from other games yet at the same time i get the nostalgic and refreshing feel when i play the combat is interesting and unlike most games the character switching mechanic is quite the interesting take on the party dynamic. Then there's the art style, the graphics, and the voice acting these are all top notch (some of the female voices are a bit too high pitched for my tastes but thats fine) so keep it up.",Positive,497,94
Suyash Mahajan,2020-10-05 19:06:22,"The game is superb. I never imagined that we can able to play a big game in our mobile phones thanks to developers.

katerina Kravchenko,2020-09-28 21:12:20,"so far I love it. I have been looking for a game like this for a long time. it has legend of Zelda breath of the wild feel to it, and I love it. i am so glad I pre-registered for it, and tried it out. I also love the voice overs. At first I thought that Paimon might be a bit annoying, but she's growing on me.",Positive,310,68
Blumins,2020-09-30 23:04:59,"So far the game has been going great! The backstory and the amount of characters is amazing. Theres a reason why this is a big game, and I thank you for that reason.

Once again thank you for releasing this game I've been waiting since the start and I just can't stop playing this!!",Positive,412,77
German 664,2020-10-11 12:58:55,"Literally a triple A title on your phone, you need an expensive phone to enter though and the progression isn't all that great.

Bruh Moments,2020-09-29 20:51:32,I love this game so much. It has everything down to be a good game and it should stay the way it is. The only thing that could use some fixing is if there were a power saving feature because the game drains your devices battery so fast. Otherwise its the perfect game and I can't say anything else is wrong with it.,Positive,315,63
Mike Jones,2020-10-20 02:46:51,"Such an Amazing game to be able to come to Mobile!!! Love the no ""auto everywhere"" combat system is fun. So is the Multi-player!! Still trip on how big the map is and places you can freely go!!!! Best game to come out on this year!!!!!",Positive,235,46
Scott Maiura,2020-09-30 10:48:12,"I'm addicted to the game the animation and graphics are awesome the story so far is great and the fact they pay attention to detail from free roaming, gliding, climbing, puzzles and selective speech during conversations down to fighting conditions, status effects, and explaining everything are terrific definitely recommend playing to others.",Positive,343,52
Matthew Wilbur,2020-10-04 08:18:23,"Nice graphics, cross platform, open world, fun game-play. The story isn't half bad. The game doesn't feel littered with fetch quests all over the map. Exploring actually feels rewarding. Usually I am not a fan of Gacha/Cash grab games, but this is pretty good so far, & I haven't hit a paywall yet. Overall a fun game, & worth checking out.",Positive,340,61
Euro,2020-10-04 00:49:39,"Overall great game and really great graphics not to mention the amount of events, quest, bosses, monsters, npc, and the treasures are infinite and the map is really huge! So we wont get bored easily. The characters is charming and very unique. Though sometime gacha luck can be a bit of a problem but it depends on your own luck. This is really a great game to the android platformer. Thank you and keep on developing this game!",Positive,428,78
Richard C.,2020-10-04 16:57:56,"Completely on par./level to be categorized with games like Skyrim/Lost Odyssey/etc.. . Only negative downside's for me so far is the lack of customization for buttons/button layouts, and customizable graphic settings for different screen/display type's & phone brand/model type's. Don't get me wrong about the negative downsides I would still strongly recommend to my friend's and other's. To download/install and play.",Positive,419,61
Caleum,2020-09-29 22:08:49,"The load times and wait times are worth it. This game has so much detail put into it. Honestly, I've only started it and just... WOW. That being said, it's likely going to have payment based options. However, if I could just get the whole game for free on the Nintendo Switch for $60, I might just consider oumping money into it.",Positive,329,62
Gabriel Farcili,2020-09-29 10:21:52,"Incredible! A little heavier than my phone can support, but I'm sure that soon will be in and upgrade in the game it will flow a little bit smoother than before. But I truly recommend this game it's really good it's a really well done hard work and if you like RPG you really love this game.",Positive,291,57
Captain Ghaziabad,2020-10-18 16:49:40,"This game is fantastic, but the only problem i have is that I can't transfer my data, when I'm moving through servers. I was playing on American Server, but I now want to change it to Asia, but I'll have to start playing from the very beginning, pls do something bout it.",Positive,271,52
Micha Chernobyl Malana,2020-10-16 22:17:48,"This is such a beautiful game. Good gameplay interface, great storyline so far, and very nice voice overs. The game reminds me of a very well made ""Tales of"" series. I find it very well crafted and not overly complicated. The characters are lovable and the graphics are very well made.",Positive,285,51
el jotari Kujo,2020-11-12 01:43:20,the game itself is amazing graphics are fantastic but cut sences just don't work and I can't get past them to continue the game,Positive,127,24

Jack Reaper,2020-09-30 06:02:23,"this is how open world rpg is supposed to. the interaction between player and the world itself is very good. i think this is the best mobile open world rpg so far. for all the kids who experiencing lags and such, it's because your phone or whatever device you play at sux. don't blame the devs because of that, blame your life instead.",Positive,335,63
Jacob Voegele,2020-10-04 08:14:57,Day 1 player on Pc and android player. The story is great. Game play is good. The graphics are really good. Also the 2 best parts is its cross platform so your characters/progress is the same and even though u can buy crystals to get get the store stuff its not necessary. It's super easy to get the crystals to buy the chests.,Positive,327,63
Angelo McAinag,2020-10-27 04:36:07,"The game has room for improvements but I'd rate it 5 stars with reason of the game being free but still fun to play even after the endgame. Although it takes a lot of time to get proper rewards, the game is still exciting.",Positive,222,44
Gerry DeWolfe,2020-10-02 17:16:05,"I've reviewed maybe 3 games on mobile over the years and that's only because I was prompted to and, they were decent enough games so I thought what the heck... THIS game however, quite simply, is off the hook. I chased down the review instead of the reverse. This game is fantastic. I don't know if this is or, will be available on PC/console but it absolutely should be. I'll be looking into it right after this. If there were a x2 multiplier for stars given, I'd hammer it- Thank you for this!",Positive,495,93
Vincent Azaria,2020-09-28 20:44:26,"This game slaps. I really like how they've made the world, it's vibrant with many exploration spots and atmospheric making it feel mystic and wonder, the mechanics are similar to BOTW which I don't mind and the combat is really satisfying and fluid. My only disappoinment is my phone not being able to run this at the highest graphical settings.",Positive,345,60
TruNova,2020-09-29 00:42:19,"This is game that gives you a whole console experience on your phone, free of charge. I don't even need to say anything else, the game delivers amazing graphics, a solid story, and a large open world experience all within the confines of your phone. Did I mention cross-platform servers so you can play with the boys over on PS4. One more thing, its free man.",Positive,359,66
Lonely Sloth,2020-10-08 17:30:34,"Phenomenal game but seems to be lacking late game content and the current late game content is locked behind resin which imo should increase with God statue level. A feature I would like to see is a 6-8 player raid event or maybe a defend the hill from waves of enemies with 6-8 player coop, and also maybe a Mount and pet system or housing system. Just my two cents. TLDR: incredible graphics, massive open world which is fun to explore due to the massive amount of puzzles, loveable characters",Positive,495,90
Aiesar edzuddin,2020-09-30 01:00:17,"Ok here's the deal. It is a best game for someone who like open world sandbox game and anime. The graphics are nice and I also install in my pc gaming. So the deal with one star is that the game graphics requirement is quite high and it is not design for ""potatoes phone"". If someone stupidly rate it one star for graphics is to high and you can ignore it because mihoyo already warn that it don't run smoothly for phone that doesn't have good spec.",Positive,449,87
Norhazman Aeman,2020-10-07 05:47:20,"I truly enjoyed this game on my phone though it only reached 45 fps rarely 60fps, yet it's still enjoyable. I find it quite hard to believe the high graphics for android is actually the lowest graphics on PC, and furthermore, I wish Mihoyo will try to collaborate with Honkai team and create an event where Honkai characters appear in Genshin Impact. I believe many people would love to see that.",Positive,396,71
Jake V,2020-10-05 03:19:32,"Genuinely impressed by this game. Graphics are really quite good, fighting mechanics quite indepth. Story's good, been playing three days now and feel no where near done, also happy to note I haven't watched a single Ad or felt coaxed into spending my money, although I'd be happy to spend a bit in future to support the makers.",Positive,328,58
Blamer Beatbox,2020-09-29 05:18:42,"This is an incredible game, I haven't even thought about uninstalling it a single bit and quite a lot of games make me want to do that and I'm glad this is the game that doesn't because it has the right amount of challenges in my opinion at least. This is a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê game so keep up the great work, this game has incredible potential.",Positive,331,65
Omri Stier,2020-10-15 22:01:53,"I am a few hours into the game and so far I'm having a blast. What seems like a Breath of the Wild knockoff actually feels like a different game entirely. You have the explanation perks from Zelda but also lots of new stuff you see in these types of games. The most amazing thing is that while playing I forget that this game is on my mobile. Great music and gameplay, I encourage everyone to at least try it.",Positive,409,80
Juan Naibaho,2020-10-04 02:10:43,"VERY GOOD open world Game , the graphics is awesome, every characters are unique, this game make you think what character the best i use to kill the monsters, you can play Single and Multi(co op) over platform like PC + Android + iOS + PS4. The In app Purchases in the game is not the main, You can free to play without worry left behind by your friends.",Positive,354,69
Draigiel Will,2020-10-14 07:59:20,"Finaly a good game has been released for mobile (and more) The voice actors, music and graphics are top tier and someone really knew what they where doing when making the characters personalities. I'm wary of the gacha element to the game but so far it has been generous in giving everyone a free chance. I also haven't noticed any pressure to pay money to win. Sometimes the audio has some minor glitching but restarting the game fixes it.",Positive,440,79
Suraj Shrestha,2020-09-29 23:48:06,"Very fun to play, it's addictive, makes me want to keep coming back. I loved the open world part of the game, keep wanting to explore more. Story is interesting too. I also like the reward system, you get everything (resources, weapons, etc.) also while exploring.",Positive,264,46
b king,2020-10-10 11:57:18,"Better than most AAA games so much love was poured into this game and it shows really astonished by the attention to detail. Most phone games have bad translations and crappy voice acting, this game goes above and beyond in both departments gameplay is fluid band rewarding there's dungeons a pretty free gacha system a huge world map a plethora of different characters and items but it lets you into them easy enough that you don't become overwhelmed with all the options and customization.",Positive,491,84
Nihilist Mich,2020-10-05 18:28:51,"This game is absolutely gorgeous, amazing and astonishingly well done for a mobile game, it can compete with TLOZ no problem.

Just download it already and give it a try.",Positive,322,57
Bagas Andreansyah,2020-10-11 10:18:43,"Good game, ever play gacha style game and i think this is one of them but with 3D open map gameplay. Yes, an adventure action RPG on an open map gameplay is awesome in my experience, so much thing can be explored, i know gacha is annoying for players, but as i know, gacha game is the best way for developer maintain its income so the game wont be closed easily.",Positive,362,71
A G,2020-10-05 15:12:08,"The game is so great thanks to the developer they make a stand to be different than other rpg style or trend i enjoy a lot. May i suggest to the developers to include on planning the future update gameplays such as arena duels on different players and to take it further, guild wars and seige war. This is to keep the players grinding, since as i and the most review says, its just about uneding grinding for now no goal or aim.",Positive,428,83
fortess draco,2020-09-28 20:46:56,"The game is on heavy side, need latest chipset to perform well at my SD845 still has some FR drop.

And if possible improve the server ( currently the ping is quite high even if i play in my region ) tested using 3 different Internet",Positive,381,69
Jeff Hue,2020-09-29 15:33:07,"This game officially pushes the boundaries for conventional mobile game. One moment I'm on pc, another moment I'm continuing on mobile.

Just an overall ground breaking game.",Positive,340,55
xXTotalVoidXx,2020-09-29 11:07:51,"Honestly, when it comes to graphics andinovation. This game ceases to impress. For one, it's the first open world game I have ever seen on a phone and for it being the first it's well polished and quite impressive. I hope to see alot of characters, abilitys and worlds added to the game. It's definitely worth the extra gigs of storage.",Positive,336,61
lord odin27,2020-10-04 04:11:39,"The most amazing game for mobile i have ever played. Graphics are off the charts, the controls are easy to use its a 100% manual play unlike all those auto rpgs out nowadays, story is very unique, and the free roam its like assasins creed how u can climb anything and everything there's no limits. 2 thumbs up to developers keep up the great work.",Positive,347,65
Choco VV,2020-10-28 00:26:44,"overall experience for me is good. the only problem for me is the character switching, when i switch characters while batling , the setup also changes which is a hindrance when doing a combo. kinda wish to have switching style like the pc version have, a stable one.",Positive,266,48
Sona The Sweet,2020-10-12 05:07:47,"This game is Loved. Okay, so this game looks Beautiful and runs Fantastically. The Game Macanics are incredible. The below is for the development team. It would be nice if the camera function had more poses. It would also be nice if we could ""hide"" what weapons we are currently using and instead equip another weapon for the Visuals without affecting the stats of the weapons hidden. You all did fantastic and have good work here. Thank you for giving us this amazing game!",Positive,474,84
Mie Vvvv,2020-10-11 06:49:36,I love this game. I love openworld games but the problem is that's I usually don't get far as it gets pretty boring. I was a little meh about the game at first because I personally prefer customization but that doesn't matter to me anymore by how everything else makes up for the lack. I can see some people say that it's a p2w game which I don't understand and don't agree with at all. I save for rolls and got pretty good characters. The odds to get a good char are really good compared to other.,Positive,498,97
Juan Fajardo,2020-10-03 08:34:55,"The game is worth the wait. Good graphics, interesting story line, easy to pick up and overall fun battle system.

Chris Kerr,2020-10-04 09:36:39,"This is, without a doubt, the best mobile game and best gacha game ever. I play cross save on PC, and it's amazing there as well.

Skuma,2020-09-30 20:06:49,"Great game super fun, a bit hard to control on mobile. Takes some time to get use to the controls. Worth the download, theres a lot of unique quests to have fun.

Muhd Zaidani,2020-09-29 12:43:23,"Love every single bit in this game. From the art of the characters and environment, to the combat mechanics and the story. This is truly the biggest feat in mobile gaming industry. And if you don't like playing on phones, there's also PC version and you can crossplay between mobile and PC! Totally amazing! There is one big issue for me though and that is stutters that occur during cutscenes. Not sure if its due to my phone, SamsungGalaxyS10e on Exynos or because the game is not well optimised.",Positive,498,89
anna georgiou,2020-10-05 02:53:34,"Amazing, I've been playing this since it release and am absolutely loving it. The art style is beautiful, story is entriguing and characters are fun.

Nyan Fooz,2020-11-17 08:20:27,"I'm an android version player. And my main character is fischl. After the new version1.1 update when aimed shot is used I can't seem to move the camera angle to up,down or side ways it's really hard to kill ruin guards now cuz the aiming won't work as it did in the previous version please fix this",Positive,298,57
Khoa,2020-11-17 08:06:43,"Great game, excellent production for free to play gacha. The gacha part is also less pronounced since you can enjoy all content with free, guaranteed characters.",Positive,161,26

wilko10000,2020-11-17 07:44:29,"Great game. Plus the fact you can smoothy transition from PC to Android and back, and just pick up where you left off on either platform, with literally zero compromises on the mobile version... Mind-blowing!!",Positive,209,35
Navi,2020-11-17 07:41:36,"Been waiting for this game since last year, and it didn't disappoint. Having played games like LoZ BOTW and loving it, having another game like that I can say this is probably one of the best open world games with a lot of stuff to do",Positive,234,46
Setiawan Wijaya,2020-11-17 07:31:12,"Overall great, no need to mention anything But i'd like to inform the devs about Qiqi and Jean Bug, Qiqi passive and ultimate doesn't heal other characters who attacked the shielded mob. While Jean ultimate sometimes did nothing, exactly nothing, no healing, no damage, no animation. I hope you can still listen to almost all users about resin recharge time.. 5 minutes would be perfect Thank you",Positive,396,67

Cyrus Daryl Sta. Ana,2020-11-17 07:27:13,"I am still playing so I will leave the comment for later. Edit: After finishing story and exploring the world, there is nothing to do. I log in to use resin and do commisions and that's it. Been doing same thing for a few weeks now and I'm getting tired of it. Hopefully the 1.1 update will give something new. Edit: The update is great. The Fischl event now makes you log in and do something while exploring the world. If there's an event like this more often then it does not get boring.",Positive,489,94

Btsjk entertainment,2020-11-17 03:44:14,"It's a very fun game, it does take a whole lot of time to download the data in the beginning but it allows you to leave the app, it sends a notification when its done.

Kira Zero,2020-11-17 02:02:07,"Despite being free to play, the efforts of animation, music, lore, voice acting and overall aesthetic they put into this makes it so it's an absolute crime not to throw money at MiHoYo.",Positive,185,33
Pedro Orozco,2020-11-17 01:53:45,"Simple story, better learning environment (about how to use the game), easy controls, a need for skills and a desire for adventure! Just what makes this game fun and entertaining, making it so much more than a game. This is a story that the player can make as they go, or simply follow the quest to level up and enjoy.

Daniel Zillmann,2020-11-17 01:33:47,"Great open world and exploration. Definatly ok to F2P or even pay to support... but I disagree you GOT to have ONLY 5 star weapons and characters. Thats just forcing yourself to spend money. Be happy with your pulls, its better to have a max 4 star weapon or character then a base level 5. I got a 4 star character, half way up the constilation chart, with a fair 4 star weapon. Definarly holds their own. Even when i had a good 3 star on them, they were doing great",Positive,466,91

Konakiri,2020-11-17 00:28:42,I can say with ease that this is my favourite mobile game I've ever played. Almost verything about this game is great except the resin system which is a major issue for players after Adventure Rank 30. That's basically the only downfall of this game not counting the minor ones like the online servers but for a game that's free that can run on mobile is pretty amazing,Positive,369,68

tommy h,2020-11-16 16:10:44,There is actual gameplay which is a huge plus over other gatcha games. Story is ok. Only downside is the open world's rewards dont scale well with the rest of the content. Lots of people seem to just end up ignoring it and just focusing only on the content gated by the energy system as a result. I'd prefer if the open world gets more lucrative content as it is clearly this game's biggest strength.,Positive,400,75

muyu,2020-11-15 06:08:40,"To be honest, a game like this shouldn't even require you to use Wi-Fi. Since it's more like solo game like legend of zelda and co-op just gives you the option whether or not you want to play with your friends or other players. Also, the game needs some optimization, since it doesn't really run smoothly even at low graphic settings with mid-range phones. So it's more likely more compatible and smooth to play with a highspec or gaming phone. Still, I love the game! Superb for mihoyo :^)",Positive,490,89

Other than that I think it's one of the best games of the year and a promising one.",Positive,343,61
